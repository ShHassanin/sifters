B00007LB1E,Koala Baby Musical Mobile - Locomotion: Baby,baby,2 of 2,2.0,"Very cute collection, but skip the mobile","July 18, 2005",Lovebeingamommy,"Los Angeles, CA","I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it.",United States,CA

B00007LB1E,Koala Baby Musical Mobile - Locomotion: Baby,baby,2 of 4,1.0,dangerous---hook broke off and mobile fell on baby,"December 29, 2004",CSM,"Fairfax, VA","We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day! Like I said before, other than this, it has been great.",United States,VA

It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency.When it works the sound quality is very good, although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep. We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds.  The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby's mattress.

Barnes,"Bay Area, CA","This high chair was great to start, but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals. I thought it was me, at first, not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp. Reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now, 3 months later, she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor. I am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground.

Fowler,"Louisville, Kentucky United States","I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years. Pros:I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient. The cons:Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months.",United States,KY

She wasn't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise, all of those things she would grow into though.  The part I couldn't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were.  She tried to chew on the see-saw (teething, everything goes to the mouth) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her.  It was a pitiful sight. Poor baby. I don't know why they didn't allow just a little more tray space  and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads.  I think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy, but as it is now I think it's just a little too ""rough around the edges"".

It was a super snug fit in the crib and now in her toddler bed it still is a perfect fit.  I decided that for this baby I didn't want to spend as much for a mattress because it did seem silly. HOWEVER, this mattress didn't fit snug in my crib nor did it have the firm feel.  This is a medium quality mattress for a medium price.  I bought it yesterday and took it back today.

We've either traded up or found a substitute for most of the things in here. Here's what I found: Item #1) The case is fine, but things do fall out all the time.  #2) I haven't used the tweezers yet, but the magnifying part sounds nice.  #3) The nail clippers were WAY TOO SHARP. We cut my daughter's skin more than once (but one was serious enough that we considered a hospital trip!) Now we use my regular clippers, and I haven't gotten her skin since. The soft grip thing actually make them slide around more, so it was tougher to cut where you wanted to. Trust me, it's easy to clip skin on fingers that little!  #4-7) The emery boards are very handy, but any emery boards would work.  #8) We got a different thermometer; this one was too slow. Faster ones are more expensive, but they're worth it for a sick squirmy baby.  #9) I haven't used the medicine dropper, but the one time she did need one, I actually asked at the pharmacy desk at a grocery store, and they gave me one for free (then later I found out we had this one.)  #10-11) The brush and comb are nice. I'm sure they can be purchased separately from the kit for less.  #12) My daughter's only 7 months old, and has no need for a toothbrush for awhile, since there are no teeth (and even when there are, I believe you wipe them with gauze, not a toothbrush for awhile.)Basically, although this kit had tons of things that could be helpful and it wasn't very expensive, we have either gotten an upgrade on the things we use (thermometer), or have found other things that would work just as well (regular nail clippers, free medicine dropper.) I'm certainly not saying that you shouldn't get one, because I'd hate to say that and then have you find that you needed it.

B0006N8XJG,Munchkin Baby Food Chopper: Baby,baby,21 of 21,1.0,Don't waste your money,"September 16, 2005",Sylvia,"Vancouver, BC","I bought this to puree my 6 month old daughter's homemade baby foods.  You put the blade at the bottom of the cup, load the food in, then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece (which contains the motor) on top.  The concept seemed good and it is a compact size.  CONS:  1) The cup holds less than 1 cup of food...if you go over that amount, any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess, and sometimes causes the motor to stop running...guess it shorts it out and I have to wait until it dries out before I can start again.  If you're trying to make enough to freez cubes of food, you'll have to puree several batches.  2) You can only run the motor for short periods of time...up to 20 seconds max or something like that for some foods.  This is fine for soft foods, but if trying to puree meats, for example, it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind, wait, grind, wait....3) the motor that powers the blade is way too slow, cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy, since you really need a faster blade to puree them.  I've found that the for pureering baby foods, the best thing to use is a blender, since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed.

But it has a *major* flaw:The strap that comes up between the legs is too close to the back of the seat.

This mean that the buckle was way too low and tight, forcing the belts to cut into her chunky thighs and pushing uncomfortably on her pubic bone. I asked around online on some forums, and found many other mothers who returned this seat for the same reasons. Many mothers didn't find it a problem until their child was at least 20 lbs, but it was a problem for me already, because we use cloth diapers, so my baby's butt is bigger due to the 'padding.'This car seat wouldn't work well if your child is chunky or uses cloth diapers... and even otherwise, I can't see how it would work for a child over 25 lbs or so...

I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day.  I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain.  They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt.

First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.

After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag. ",United States,CA

These spill, you have to store them upright in the freezer...and if your freezer is as compact as mine with food to feed five people, storing milk upright is just too hard to do.  These bags do NOT have a ziplock seal on them, which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry (like if you have more than one kid and you work).Buy the Gerber or the Lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them.  They can both be stored flat for more convenience, and they can stand on their own.  Pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump (the Medela bags), or you can use your Medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a Gerber or Lansinoh storage bag for ease.  I use the Medela Lactina Plus, and I find that this method works the best for me.  Simple, clean and easy. ",United States,WA

They have an easy-to-use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing.

""Lissa325i""",Northern KY United States,"I purchased this swing because we were out of town and it was much needed.  We have the full sized Papasan swing and the travel Ocean Wonders swings at home (which in retrospect, we were wishing we brought with us).  While neither of those are 100% perfect, they are much better than this one.  The open frame allows the child to kick the swing frame, stop the swing from moving, and potentially get their feet/legs stuck in between the bars.  ALso, the swing seat almost lays horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position)while swinging, to the point that I am afraid if my daughter would wiggle a bit, she would end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Lastly, the mobile is horrible.  It's pitiful and I find it hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market.  It's a plastic leaf that has little notches for two toys on strings.  The strings have a not on the end of them and you slide it into the notches.  These toys remain on the notches for approximately 3 seconds.  It's a very poor design and needs a LOT of work.  And my daughter ends up in a crumbled up ball on one side of the swing more times than not - it doesn't seem to have the support that our other 2 swings have.That said, the swing is very attractive and appealing.

I should have noticed the word ""wrap"", but I didn't give it too much thought. There are two main problems with this baby carrier:1. You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house. I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees. There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot, wrap myself up, put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion.2. It is HOT. Yes, this is a nice, stretchy breathable fabric, BUT, the fabric is much, much bulkier than standard baby carriers. Again, I hate to harp on the weather here, but there's no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top.I'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them. Otherwise, you'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them.On the plus side, it's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of.",United States,GA

We like the Playtex Premium Nurser and the Playtex Ventaire (chubby bottles) MUCH better.  We tried the regular Dr. Browns, but she choked on the nipple so we ordered the chubby bottle that has the nipples more like the breast.  With both kinds she sucked too hard and ate too fast...when I sat her up to burp her after her usual 5 minutes (@ one ounce with the Playtex bottles), to my surprise she had already sucked down 3 ounces!  We had a horrible night both times we tried the Dr. Browns - she cried all night from a bad tummy ache from the fast flow (we used the slow flow nipples even!).  I also have a friend that had the same problem with her baby choking and gagging on the slow flow nipples' too-fast-flow (formula fed baby).  I HIGHLY recommend the Playtex bottles - they are easy to clean and never leak.  We only tried Dr. Brown to see if it would alleviate the GERD symptoms - it did not!!!!",United States,IL

I spent so much time shaking, wiggling and kicking the thing I was very quickly exasperated. When you flip the top, it created much bigger gaps on the two sides than the older model.

When you do clip it on to the cart, the front end is suspended in the air. I just put it sideways which is a pain. Also, the handle bar is built to be easier to carry...I don't agree. It is still awkward- I end up hooking it under my arm. Lastly, to put the handle bar up and down is very difficult. You have to squeeze the taps on both sides and really push hard to get it to release. I'm sorry that I don't have any others to recommend.

The first couple of months weren't bad, but after about 3 months or so, it really started to smell bad.  This horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on.We tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell-letting it ""air out"" outside, cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution, putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner, letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water...we even bought some scented disc type things (can be purchased at Babies R Us) that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse.We continued to use it, but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with Lysol or something.  Eventually we used it less and less, and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago-we'd had it for almost 2 years.

The Britax had previously been highly rated, but the latest test trashed it. We were surprised, becuase it is the first seat we have owned (on our 3rd kid), that really was rock solid snug once installed. I bought a Graco Snugfit, and I have nothing good to say about it.

B000BMEYFO,Graco Snugride Infant Car Seat &#45; Family Tree: Baby,baby,8 of 13,1.0,We searched far and wide and thought this was the best infant carseat on the market. It's not.,"October 14, 2006",goonius,a room in a house on a street in a city just like any other.,"In our pursuit for ultimate baby items, the infant carseat topped our list. What's more important than the safety of your first child, especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving? Our search led us to this Graco carseat, and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a Christmas gift, just before our daughter's birth in January.The seat is fairly attractive, but its good points stop there. It's a bear to install. Not because it's complicated, but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man (or a woman, unlike myself certainly) to install the base. We ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about 5 minutes tugging on the belts with all his might, and then huffed and puffed and told us ""That should be in there real good, now."" We examined it, and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car, and he replied, ""Oh they all do that, that's normal.""Unsure, but with the safety rating to back it, we continued to use it. Throughout her first 7 months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment. Lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat (we have 3 4-door sedans, a 1992 Subaru Legacy, an 80-something Oldsmobile, and my mom's 2006 Saturn Ion. With the seat already in the car, it's a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once - for me. My husband simply can't put her in with the carseat already in the car. Not to mention that, the seat - while installed in the car - has never felt especially stable, with the exception of my mom's Ion, which has the latch system. Of course, the drawback of the Ion is that my 6'1"" husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he cannot move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard.Then, in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we're driving. Literally, go around a curve, look back, and her seat's at a 45 degree angle from the backseat of the car. My daughter is 8.5 months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat. We've checked the belts that secure the seat, pulled with all our might, and the seat continues to malfuction. This is a safety issue if I've ever seen one. With enough force, she could end up directly on her side, say the force of a side impact in an accident. Upon closer inspection, I shouldn't be altogether shocked. The base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits. Sort of like a wine glass, I suppose - so it's top heavy, and likely the heavier the load on top, the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation.Needless to say, we'll begin shopping for a new seat immediately. As for the Snugride, I would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it. I'd certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system, and I'd still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system. In hindsight I wish I had shopped around a bit more.",Canada,ON

Waste of Money!,"June 12, 2006",OneLuckyMom777,"Oak Harbor, WA United States","I bought this for my daughter while I was still pregnant, thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months (as well as later) in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1/2 y.o. son. It certainly wasn't cheap, so I assumed that it would be a good product, and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants. Don't let the product description fool you! Just as it says in some of the other reviews, it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling, because of it's crappy strap tightener. My daughter was a small newborn, only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months, which was the first time I tried using the sling. And even being that small, for the 2 minutes I had the sling on I could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen. (Definitely NOT safe!) Aside from that, this item is so big and bulky that I literally could not even see my daughter in it. I might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it.

It seems eccessive but I never found one that really was doing it for me. I started with Gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime I had to put the baby inside. My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable.When he got older (5 mounths) we bought a backpack carrier. This is a really really a nice buy. We loved it and so did our son. The problem with it is that I wouldn't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside. So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier. I think that's the best for newborns because they don't have to support any body part. More over, when the baby sleeps, he is in a nice position and they seem to like it (even though I though his head was in a weird angle ?!?!) As soon as the baby gets heavier (8 or 9 lbs) it's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do. It slips from its place so the head of the child doesn't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest (so when you have a large breast the baby's head is really really in a weird angle !). I think that it doesn't worth the price for the time you use it. Now that my younger son is 5 mounths, I don't use it anymore",United States,TX
B00005V6C8,Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System: Baby,baby,1 of 2,1.0,Several flaws...,"January 12, 2007","J. Frazier ""saiwulfaz""","Walla Walla, Washington, USA","I've owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for just under 2 years.  At first, I thought it worked fine.  It was easy to deal with, and easy to empty.  The first liner that it came with lasted me 6 months (1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2's).However, the unit failed to control odors after about 9 months.  Since then I've had to hide it in various places of my home to keep the odor to a minimum.  Definitely not convenient.The unit has one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control.  Unlike the Diaper Champ which allows you to deposit a diaper without opening the container and letting odors escape, Diaper Dekor has no such provision.  It has two ""trap doors"" that allow you to drop the diaper in easily, and then they are supposed to spring back into place.  Still, no matter how quickly you drop that diaper in, and let the top lid fall closed, strong odors inevitably escape.  Also, these ""trap doors"" are quite flimsy.  The hinge on one of them recently broke so that the door no longer springs back into its closed position, thereby contributing to the odor problem.  I inquired about a replacement from Regal Lager and they said I could purchase one for $10.  Instead I decided to purchase a new Diaper Champ, since I've pretty much had it with this thing.Speaking of flimsy, there are two other flaws I've experienced.  Firstly, the plastic foot pedal has cracked and seems loose.  It still works, but I have to wonder for how much longer.Also, the door on the bottom of the unit that enables you to cut off the bag and remove it does not close very tightly, once again contributing to a lack of odor control.  The door is only held shut by a small plastic latch, leaving a significant gap for odors to escape.Overall, I have not been impressed with Diaper Dekor Plus.  However, contrary to what some people say regarding the liner refills, that actually was never one of my bigger complaints.  I did not find them cost-prohibitive at all, because you get 3 liners for $20 and I found that 3 liners will last me about 6 months of holding toddler-size diapers.  In the 1 year 9 months that I've owned this system, I've only had to purchase refills twice.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that I did find it inconvenient to have to purchase liners online (couldn't find any local store that carried them) and wait for them to be shipped to me, especially when there is no indication of when you will reach the end of your last liner.Diaper Dekor is the only system I have used extensively, and I would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone.  I'm hoping my Diaper Champ will serve me better",United States,WA

B000BGJSE2,Fisher-Price Fun To Learn Potty: Baby,baby,7 of 7,2.0,Leave the batteries out for potty training,"January 18, 2007",Nicole S.,"Chandler, AZ","I bought this potty because I thought it was SOOOO cute, looking like a real toilet with the toilet paper roll and everything!  I still think it's cute, but just like many other reviewers say, all the music and talking and sounds are WAY too distracting to be able to actually learn potty training.  And, like other reviewers say, the sensor is NOT accurate, so it's always saying the child went potty when they didn't.  Very confusing for a child who's trying to learn to really ""go"" in the potty.We're currently potty training our daughter, and we have three training potties -- this one, an older one that has a soft seat, and one that fits into the ring of the big toilet -- and this potty is the last one my daughter will pick when it's ""potty time.""  When we first got it she had a blast with it, using it as a toy and nothing more.  Now that the newness has worn off, she shows very little interest in it.  If I had it to do over, I would have given her this potty without the batteries in it and without her even knowing it had the capability to make all the sounds.  Here's a suggestion:  Don't put in the batteries until your child has mastered potty training.  Then, as a reward for his/her accomplishment, put batteries in and show your child what the potty can do.  With the training part out of the way, the sounds won't be such a distraction anymore",United States,AZ

B000BGJSE2,Fisher-Price Fun To Learn Potty: Baby,baby,7 of 7,1.0,A HUGE disappointment.,"December 18, 2006",nikola,"Orlando, FL United States","We bought this thinking our son would love the neaty gadgets and sounds...We had several major issues with it.1)  The pee guard.  It doesn't really latch on and STAY on.  Our son was irritated with the pee guard we he was first learning and kept ripping it off the seat then throwing it accross the room.  As luck would have it, when I would go retrieve the item, he would pee and since there was no guard, the pee would go everywhere BUT in the seat/ pot.   To resolve this I had to use special adhesive for plastics (super glue didn't work AT ALL) which took 24 hours to set which interuppted our potty training.  It also turned part of the seat yellow which made it look dirty even when it was not.  But I had no choice- the guard HAD to stay on.2) The sensors were too sensitive and would go off even when he did nothing.  He could just sdjust his position in the seat and it would tell him he did a great job going potty even though he never went.3) The sounds and gadgets were TOO distracting.  He wanted to play with them and would turn around in the seat and this would sometimes be when he was about to pee and it would end up all over me/ the floor/ whatever was nearby.  I finally just took the batteries out and told him it was broken.4) When he was ready to use the actual potty, we took it apart per direction and placed it on top of one of our toilet seats.  Everytime he pees I have to hold down his ""bits"" because the seat does not go all the way down to make a seal between the potty seat and the toilet seat, thus it leaks out from under the potty seat onto the toilet seat and then down the front of the toilet and onto his pants/ underware/ etc.  The pee guard is useless for this feature. Sometimes even when I do hold his stuff down, if he wiggles or moves, then he is not in position... There is only one position he can be in or it will go all over the seat and down the toilet and onto his clothes.It was the most expensive toilet seat available at the store.  We thought we would be getting a top quality seat from begining to end of our son's potty training experience.  The price is what motivated me to try and make it work for us.  Finally, I threw the darned thing in the garbage and just got a circo toilet seat with a pee guard for the toilets.  It was the least expensive toilet adapter and it turned out to be the best.If we have another child, I am going to get the basic toilet seat/ no frills and the inexpensive toilet adapter.  Both together were a fraction of what we paid for this seat and would be a million times less aggrevating.DON'T waste your money",United States,FL

I attached the velcro at the tightest position possible but my son still managed to squeeze his little arms out the neck - not a pretty sight. The next problem I ran into is that while the bottom of the wrap is supposed to support the baby's feet like a womb, my son out of frustration to get out of it would just bust the bottom completely out so that his legs were completely exposed.  In fact, he tore the velcro that secures the bottom pouch to the top.

I can find a place to put the parent cupholder, but there is no place at all to put the child's snack tray.  The stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller.  The whole purpose of spending the money on this ""system""  (which was considerably more expensive than others in the store) was for my child to have a snack tray.  Therefore, it's going back to the store.  There are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this... even the Prince Lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive... The product itself is also very cheaply made.  The ""s"" hooks look so flimsy I wouldn't trust them... again, they sell thicker, sturdier ""s"" hooks that look like they will work much better than this, so that's what I'll purchase.  Plus, the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy... already the ""arms"" have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter!    Thirdly, I'm not sure if it was the ""clips"" that came in my packet (perhaps a defect) or if they are all made this way... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips... and then they didn't fasten correctly.  No matter how I tried (I worked on it for close to an hour and I consider myself pretty good at these things!), I could not get the clips to tighten properly.  They continued to be loose... even with using the smaller screws.  Perhaps my stroller tubing is ""too small""??? Very unlikely, but it just might be the case.  This is going back to the store, where I will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $5, a package of two (thick) ""s"" hooks for $3 and my child will have to learn to ""deal"" with holding her snack cup and straw cup.  I will save myself $10, a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly, and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items!!!

The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The ""restraints"" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The ""adult drink cup holder"" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The ""saddle bags"" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach.

B000BU4CHQ,Kolcraft Wrangler Twin Sport All-Weather: Baby,baby,1 of 1,2.0,"COULD be a great stroller, but NOT BUILT to last.","February 16, 2007",archaeoamy,Arizona,"Exactly 3 months after I bought this stroller, a bracket on the back that holds the bars together popped off, making it dangerous and impossible to use.  Luckily I bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund (in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously).  When I tested the stroller at the store, I thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it wouldn't last long (which is why I bought the warranty), but the idea of having such a great stroller is why I decided to take the chance.  PROS for the stroller:  very light, compact and easy to fold; easy to maneuver; great for tall people like me--don't have to hunch over to reach the handles.  There are some nice little things too, like ventilation for the back, a headrest, a cup-holder, and a reclining position.CONS are: only rated for carrying children under 40 lbs in each seat (didn't know this when I purchased it)--I have a 35 lb. 2 y.o. and a newborn, so we don't exceed the limit there, but my 42 lb. 3 1/2 y.o. can't use it.  The canopy doesn't cover kids well from the shade (only the face--and that's a big deal when living in southern AZ--or if it's raining)--and when the seat is reclined (for my newborn) the canopy doesn't even cover her head (I have to clip on a blanket and drape it over).  My 2-y.o. practically is too big for it--her head extends above the top of the seat.  And finally, the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy.Overall, this COULD be a GREAT stroller, but it's just not sturdy--obviously not, it broke--but one would expect that with a brand name ""Jeep"" it would be built better.  We only use it for walks and going out, no off-trail stuff--we used it about 10 times before it broke.  My umbrella stroller I bought 6 years ago is still going strong--why can't they make this just as well-built?   I would love this stroller if it were just built better",United States,NE
B000056HMV,Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump: Baby,baby,2 of 2,2.0,How to decide between this and a more expensive pump,"September 12, 2006","Jennifer ""BTDTMom.com""","Austin, TX","I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:TRY THIS ONE IF...- You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended periodINVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF...- You're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one)",United States,TX

I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong. I will simply list the things I do not like:1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had.2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any.3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary).4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those.5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks.6) The MP3 player, which is the ""cool factor"" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller.",United States,SC

I was so sick of seeing fish, butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes! But I've been so disappointed in this chair's function. With all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps, it's impossible to keep clean. The straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that I threw them into the washing machine - even though the tags says not to.The worst part of the seat is the tray. It's ridiculously wide -- too big for my dishwasher AND my kitchen sink! (And both are full sized.) The way my toddler smears food on the tray, there's no way I could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it. Washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer. Oh well, at least they get clean too...Also, I agree with other reviewers that it's really difficult to slide the tray into place. I wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like I'm torturing him. On the bright side, the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up.

The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a ""leg separator,"" which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place.  We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough.  In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings.  Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list...  I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing...

McGee ""Anxious Grandmom""","Phila. area, PA. USA","My daughter placed this crib on her registry, mainly because of  the price. She didn't want anyone spending $500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for. I found this set up at a ""Depot"" store and it was beautiful and sturdy, but didn't come in natural. So I went home and ordered it online. It arrived 4 days before the shower(8 days early from ETA)but it was shattered. The first 3 pieces we looked at were split, chipped & crushed. Quite a surprize considering the box wasn't in bad shape. We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model(at a local specialty store). Amazon's return policy was amazing, a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up. No packing labels to print, no lugging big heavy items to post office, very simple.

Once we received it, we opened it only to find that each box contained 2-3 severely  cracked pieces. After inspecting them, we found that the dmg wasn't caused by packaging but, poor craftsmanship. Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun & some of the nails were even bent. The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed & continued all the way up the piece of furniture. Had the co pre drilled the holes & used screws instead, this would've never happended. Obviously it's ""cheaper"" to use nails instead of screws. We took pictures of the dmgs & I wish I could  attach them to this review so you'd be able to see for yourself. There were also several areas inside the crib which weren't sanded properly & would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood. It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods, but in all actuality it's pine. When you think of hardwood, you expect oak or birch, not a softwood like pine. The tops of the furniture & the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood. Everything else was particle board. Some of the solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece of wood, but 3 & they were glued together. We're currently trying to return this product for a full refund. We're also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date. I would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again.",United States,FL

While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much.

As many reviewers have noted, it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly.First off, the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- Why did they choose to use teeny-tiny WHITE lettering? STUPID! It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials. In fact the difference between say, level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water! Trying doing that out of a standard faucet. In fact we use a filtered water faucet (with a thin spout) and it is still hard to get write.But that's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio! We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle (with the disposable bags) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use. Level 3--- still to cold, but wait, last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula! And just try to use a vented-type bottle...Forget it! How about an 8oz. bottle? NO WAY! Either way to cold or way to hot.And even though we use filtered water, this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar (as recommended) evey week or so.

If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better ""mouse trap"".To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...(picture provided by Amazon is not the current model.  refer to the pictures posted by other shoppers",United States,TX

His head rolled around or rolled forward.  I tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work.

Additionally, the material on the seat is not breathable--it is velvety--so my son's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips, even in the winter.  I would say that once my son was bigger (about 14 pounds and 26 inches), I removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position--this is when he actually ""fit"" into the seat, however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty, making him very uncomfortable for longer trips.

B000F1OQ1I,The Potty Patty Kit: Baby,baby,23 of 23,1.0,"Terrible doll, do not buy for potty training!","July 1, 2006",MJ,Kansas,"I bought this doll because at the expensive price, I figured it would be the best.  It definitely is not.  Patty is cute, but that is the only good thing about her.  To fill up her bottles, you must squeeze and insert into a glass of water, then squeeze again until water shoots out and then reinsert into the glass of water again.  It requires it to be done in such a particular way that only an adult can fill the bottles with water, no small child will be able to master the precise way it takes.  Then, to feed Patty you must hold her very still at an exact angle, where she is almost standing up.  Most children cradle their baby dolls in their arms, but Patty will not drink in that position.  Even in the standing up position, most of the water spills out of the tiny hole for her mouth and soaks her outfit.  It takes 5-10 minutes to fill Patty up.  Most children don't have the patience for this and lose interest, as my daughter did.  Plus since she has to be perfectly still and at an exact angle, only an adult can feed Patty her water.  Then, to make her pee, you must press her thigh very hard.  This distressed my daughter because she thought I was hurting Patty.  Once I assured her Patty was ok, then she was upset because she was not strong enough to press hard enough to make Patty pee.  My daughter is 35 months old and a lot of children start training earlier.  At 35 months old, my daughter was not able to fill the bottles, feed Patty or make her pee.  Only an adult can do these things due to the complexity of the bottles and feeding and peeing systems of Patty.  So my daughter quickly lost interest in Patty and started squirting water all over the bathroom instead with the bottles.  The whole ""teach the doll to pee"" part of the potty training was lost.  I wish I had gone to the store and bought a cheap wetting doll instead.  Then I e-mailed the company to complain, but of course received no response.  And you can't get a full refund if the doll has been used.  In fact, getting a refund at all is extremely difficult, I have just given up on that.  Don't waste your money.  This doll is too expensive and cannot be used by a child, which defeats the whole purpose.  Go to your toy store and buy a cheap wetting doll.

Big difference.  The backpack is compact, sleek, and inconspicuous but the pump sucks.  It has one adjustment for speed/suction and a computer chip that selects the best combination of the two for you.  Well, after a few pumps my nipples are about to fall off.  If I lower the suction to a comfortable, reasonable level, the pump is way too fast.  If I slow the pump to mimic MY baby's speed, the suction is excruciatingly painful--and it still doesn't pump slow enough.  I am very unhappy with this and wish we'd just rented the hospital-grade for a year instead.  The little cooler is cute, but it's tough to actually fit the frozen insert (""blue"" plastic thing) AND four bottles in there.  And it is convenient for the horns to pump directly into standard-size bottles (it will pump into Dr. Browns & Evenflo bottles too, any regular mouth size bottles) or bags.  I love the setup, just wish the pump had slower speed settings and that the speed & suction were truly adjustable and independent from each other.

B00005BTNA,Playtex VentAire Natural Shape Bottle 9 oz. - 3 pk.: Baby,baby,2 of 2,1.0,Too difficult for a newborn to suck.....no good  for the first month at least.,"January 16, 2007",Minami,California,"Initially, I thought these angled bottles make a lot of sense so I put different sizes into our registry. However, when our baby girl (1 week old) first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle, it did not come out. My husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions. He thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple, so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out. He finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does. The hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released. Baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole. For a newborn infant, it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only. Luckily we had two Avent bottles (with the traditionally hole idea) so she is doing very well with the Avent bottles and she still loves them a lot. We ended up returning the unused VentAir bottles and got a lots of AVENT bottles but still stuck with the opened ones. I do not recommend these 'difficult' bottles for newborn. Baby should not need to 'think' how to get the milk out.For leaking problem, we do not have any issue with the Avent bottles. When it leaks, it is usually because the nipples have not been properly placed (push all the way though the ring) or the ring has not been tightly screwed. We also found out if you use a warmer to warm the bottle, you have to unscrew the ring once and screw it all tight again after the warmer. It is because the theory of heat with expense the plastic bottle which creates a gap between the ring, nipples and the bottle neck. This works 99% for us with no leak.We are the fans of the AVENT bottles.",United States,CA

HOWEVER, 2 months into using these bottles, I became FED up with having to wash all of the different parts, drying them thoroughly (it's a MUST with these things), and having to ""activate"" BOTH the nipples and the ventaire plastic seal; wasting valuable time and energy that should've been spent with my family, catching up on laundry, cleaning the house, cooking, and grabbing naps in-between (I also work a full-time job and didn't get home till 6 PM every night).  The WORST of all of it is that if you don't install the vent juuuuuuust so, it leaks...the person (below) who said it doesn't leak if you screw it on right, hasn't met me - I'm 34 years old and DO believe I have learned how to screw on a stupid cap!  It's a ""hit or miss"" deal...sometimes I would go a whole week without a leak and then OUT of the blue...water EVERYWHERE!!!

The beeping from the parent unit WILL wake you at about 3am every night (unless you leave them on the charger).2) Both of my parent units now (after only two weeks of minor useage) refuse to connect with the nursery unit, beeping endlessly.  ""Cycling"" them on and off per the prescribed (though not well detailed) manufacturer's trouble-shooting method has done nothing.

My home is a very common 1800 square feet of two-story ""box"" type arrangement.  The static would become unbearable once the parent unit was taken downstairs and (maybe due to a weak or faulty nursery unit from the get-go), the signal would cut out before we even got to the kitchen.

(only available in store at Babies R Us).  It is the same as the one shown here, but it has two transmitters to montor two children.  Based on only 4 hours of testing, I am taking the unit back.  Pro:-The range was great.  Whole house, plus 800ft outside.-No interference.  I live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference.-Easy to setup.-Shape/size of parent units are much better than others (especially sony)Cons:-Controls are not very straightforward.-The unit always hisses.  It is not sound/voice activated.-The power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed.  When you turn it off, it does not beep or let you know that you did.  The button is easy to bump, and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off, and you think it is on.-The DEAL BREAKER: a power outage requires turns off child units.

B0009UBSFC,Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor: Baby,baby,3 of 3,2.0,"Good idea, but severly lacking in execution","January 31, 2007","J. Remus ""Gadget Guy""",NY USA,"My wife and I purchased this baby monitor in preparation for the arrival of our first child, and after using it for almost 2 weeks I could not be more disappointed.  We were drawn in by the promise of a clear connection that would prevent others from listening in, but the many drawbacks far outweigh this one advantage.  This is one of the more expensive and highly rated baby monitors, but you certainly don't get what you pay for here.  Pros:1.  You do get a clear connection when the unit is in range (see cons for a further explanation)Cons:1.  The biggest complaint I have is the battery life.  Even with the parent units on the lowest volume setting, you will not get more than 5 hours of use without having to recharge.  You will know when you need to recharge because the unit will start beeping loudly every 5 seconds until you put it back in the cradle to recharge.  This is a great feature to discover during the middle of the night.  The nursery unit is even worse, as it does not take rechargeable batteries and will eat through 3 AAA batteries in 6 hours unless it is plugged in.  Why they even allow this unit to operate without being plugged in is beyond me.  Basically all of the units have to be plugged in at all times.2.  I have already had a couple instances where the parent units will simply not connect to the nursery unit.  They just sit there and beep like they do if you are out of range.  This required a couple of off/on power cycles of the nursery and parent units to correct.3.  The range is not ideal.  I have a 2800 square foot, 2 story house and we have already had 1 issue where the parent unit would not connect to the nursery unit.  Granted, the units were about as far away as they can be in our house, but considering this distance was only about 60 feet, I do not think it is unreasonable to have complete coverage in our house.4.  As other reviewers have noted, the lowest volume setting can be too loud if you are a light sleeper.  Since the speaker is always on, you will hear any ambient noise in the room amplified and played on the parent unit.  Several other monitors on the market have noise thresholds and will only transmit the sound if it is above a certain volume (i.e. if the baby is crying as opposed to shifting in the crib).  Also the LEDs are also extremely bright in a dark room.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product.  We are making due with it simply because I refuse to throw away a $100 baby monitor, although I'm sure I would be much happier with a different product.  If you can deal with leaving the units plugged in at all times and only taking the parent units out of the cradle for short periods of time, then this product would probably suffice, although I'm sure you could find a much cheaper product that would work just as well",United States,NY

Dolata,"Suffolk, VA","I have never written a review, but in this case, I feel compelled to do so. I purchased the iMonitor last week as an upgrade to a Safety 1st dual monitor, for no other reason than I was tired of the interference. I was excited to learn of the digital technology, and once I got it home, I was anxious to try it. After a few nights trying it out, I was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back...let me explain:To begin with, before you buy, please be aware that the lights and sound are awfully bright and loud, which was troublesome since I am a light sleeper. I would have been able to deal with it, but there are other problems as well...there are 'clicks' and 'crackles' that are intermittent, and, like I said before, not good for a light sleeper. The final straw was on the fourth night the parent receivers lost contact with the base -- I spent a half hour resetting it, reconfiguring the layout, powering on/off -- all to no avail. It kept beeping 'Out of Range' -- I was only 10 feet from the monitor at the time. Absolutely unacceptable. In all fairness, we do have a lot of gadgets that are wireless and may have been competing with the monitor, but that isn't an excuse..it says 'Crystal Clear Clarity' and '2000 foot range', but this is not, I repeat, NOT the case.So, I packed it back up and went into Babies R Us to return it...here's the kicker: The salesperson at the store said that she agreed they had a lot of problems and she has seen more of the iMonitors returned than any other monitor. She rec'd the Sony, but it doesn't come with two parent units, so I have resigned myself to living with the Safety 1st..even with all of its interference, it is still superior, and 1/4 of the price as the iMonitor. I have no doubt that Digital is the next step in baby monitors...but so far Graco does not have it figured out...Save your money and give it some time so they can work out the obvious flaws in the system.",Australia,New South Wales

This car seat looks good on paper but that is it. When it arrived the box was completely smashed and the car seat already had a tear in it.If you have the LATCH system in your car you must find, and shove all the belts inside the seat.  Then pull them out the correct places.  Not so easy.  Then in order to attach it to the base you must pull out a metal bar and once the seat is attached, slide it back.  This is very hard.  So once there together it is a pain to take apart.For facing backwards, if the seat is not level with your car seats, use a towel or blanket.  You shouldn't have to do that.  Plus with my baby in it his feet are still squished into the rear seat.  Once you turn it forward, to get the belts adjusted, you press a button on the bottom of the car seat and pull them towards you.  This would work fine if the BASE wasn't holding them so you CAN'T MOVE THEM.  We took the car seat off the base so we could adjust the belts.  What is the point of that.  Once it is in your car the way you want it does suit it's purpose but I highly suggest buying something of better quality.  ",United Kingdom,

It's amazing how weight of a stroller is an issue with your first child, but how Herculean you become once you have two.  Also, the whole one-handed open-close feature that I craved on my single stroller is a non-issue when you have two kids because it's safest to have them strapped into carseats before dealing with the stroller anyway.

I don't want a deflector type because the doctors warn that they can scrape a little boys private area and cause them to not want to sit on the potty because it might hurt.

Esquilin,"Sasebo, Japan","I bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods.  Ten months later, I hardly ever use the darn thing.  It worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases.  My complaints with the product:- Not particularly sturdy.  The backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily.- The straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way.  Not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere.  However, everytime I remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear.  And unfortunately it seems I need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured (another complaint).- The second tray which pops on over the swing away tray (at least on my particular model) is very easily removed by my son.  He lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor.  The point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably.- This seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat.  It HAS to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over. The good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space.  It is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design.  Overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand",Japan,Kyushu

I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide, and you can't leave the pillows in place, they stand up at a 45 degree angle. I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place. This works, but obviously only if you're sitting next to them when they fall asleep! Other than that you'd have to stop the car, get out and attach them, then go again, by which time the child is probably awake anyway! To be honest, I haven't seen a better alternative yet though.

Peters ""Vicki Peters""","Newark, DE  USA","Perhaps if I hadn't already had a different type of bunting, I wouldn't be so disappointed with this one. My sister loaned me her Eddie Bauer bunting when my son was born. She will be having her next baby any week now, so I had to return it to her which meant I had to buy a new one. I saw nothing but great reviews on this product, so I picked one up.First of all, I followed the washing instructions, washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low, and it ripped at the one seam!! Based on that alone, I will be returning it.Aside from that, having used a bunting with a different design, I am not thrilled with this one. Part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you're in a car where you have heat, you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby doesn't overheat. This bunting zips down both sides to the bottom (by the way, zipping/unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around; the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot), rather than down the middle front (that style zipper was NEVER a problem). Then you have this thick cover at baby's feet and nowhere to go with it, as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car! So you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest, or you have to leave it on baby's legs.Also, the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby's face isn't covered unless you want it to be, BUT...my 5-month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face. He did it this morning on the way to daycare. This bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that. And I can't be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face!There is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great, and that this particular bunting is toasty warm. It is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w/out a snowsuit being in the way, or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination. But I don't think the design of the Urban Bundle-Me is great and I actually think this bunting is TOO warm (even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day, my son's back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat). After calling several stores and looking at all my options at Babies 'R' Us, I ended up ordering a new Eddie Bauer All-Season Bunting from Target.com (which cost less than $20 including shipping). I can't wait till it gets here. I will be returning the $60 Urban Bundle-Me as soon as I can",United States,DE

Those people who said it's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess. Gross food particles collect in every crease and corner, especially under the seat. Most importantly, the tray is way too high - even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height/weight. The tray also doesn't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair - not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap.Finally, the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand.

It seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter. The mesh back would be ideal for the hot, humid weather. It's light and easy to travel with. It seemed sturdy. Most of this was true until I used it for a month. Honestly, the seat is way too big! My daughter was forever uncomfortable b/c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep. With minimal padding (and no recline) she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around. And to top it off, the frame bent after basic use. All we did was take it in and out of the car! I was very disappointed. Maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old, but don't buy this stroller b/c you're looking for something smaller than your Graco(but better than an umbrella stroller) for your young toddler. I think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality. Every review mentioned the carrying strap b/c that's the ONLY extra feature! This stroller was not for us! ",Nippon,Okinawa

Maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many, but I think this would make the product more useable, one size fits all. Also, he is long, and the small size was too cramped.

When I first plugged it in I could not believe how quickly the wipes heated.  I thought it was great.  I did think they were way too hot after they were in a while... but a quick shake after I pulled one out cooled it down enough to make it safe.  Then a few days later I was pulling them out and the inner lid popped open... and kept popping open with every change.  THEN when I lifed the unit to put new wipes in... my $700 changing table / dresser was flooded and warped! ( I had it replaced!!)   I had not known it because the pad and a basket were on the table, too.  Same problems kept happening. So I called Combi...Customer Service told me the Instruction Manual states that the wipes are to be left in the packaging.  She said that the excess moisture which caused the flooding would be held by the packaging.  Of course I could not measure the amount of fluid... but I am not exaggerating when I say CUPS!  Even if it did hold the CUPS of water.. so when the plastic pacaking is empty and no longer has wipes,  it is filled with excess cups of moisture and then you have to remove that to dispose of it???? And although it is stated... a) there should be a warning to NEVER use wipes not in a package and b) WHY!  I bought a large ""bag"" of Huggies wipes.. there is no package to pop in.Second... she told me that the unit is not supposed to stay plugged in all the time.. and that this too, is in the Manual.  So I lookeed at that, too.  Not in the ""Usage"" part.. but on the back under ""Cautions"" it states this:  ""Unplug power cord when not in use"".  Okay.... when you have a newborn.. when are you NOT using your wipes.. LOL!  She said it should be plugged in and unplugged several times a day to keep them warm!!!  I guess a new mom is supposed to schedule that! AND... if that was an acceptable property of the product.. shouldn't there be a switch??  I would have to move the dresser every time.. or get an extention cord, of course!  Crazy! Combi gave me, what I consider, ridiculous answers.  They also need to get real when they write the Manual.

B0000AY9Y0,Avent Infant Feeding Set: Baby,baby,1 of 1,1.0,Baby swallows too much air!!!!,"March 3, 2006",Mses,NY,"I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying.So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is ""normal"" or will be ""outgrown.""

I loved all the little pockets for storing different things; it would keep all my baby changing gear and other necessities all in one place.  The picture on the cover shows it stocked full and hanging on the side of a dresser, which can be used as a changing table.  What a marvelous concept!  So, I took it out of the package, attached it to the dresser and put all of my gear onto it.  It looked very smart hanging there, and so practical!  When I came in the room the next day, it was on the floor in a crumpled lump.  So, a little disheartened, but not wanting to give up, I hooked it up to my crib, instead.  It was the next best thing and I really did like the device.  I put all of my gear on there once more, the wipes on the top shelf just like the picture, but the top shelf is so flimsy that the wipes topple off of it.  So, not only can I not hook it up to my changing table, I also can't keep all of the changing gear on it.

B000BZ6BAM,Maclaren Volo Saffron Orange Stroller: Baby,baby,17 of 17,2.0,we can't decide whether we like it or we've been had,"September 16, 2006",Andrea Voyer,"Milwaukee, WI","We purchased this stroller for its convenience in the car and for frequent travel. I think it's safe to say that we have an ambivalent relationship with the Volo, not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it a definite thumbs down.On the up side it is very light and folds easily and is compact. Not to mention that everyone gets to see you have a Maclaren stroller in a wonderful shade of orange. The stroller is great for the airport and quick shopping trips when you are in and out of the car.We first purchased the volo without springing for the seat pad. This was a mistake as our daughter was clearly uncomfortable and was unwilling to spend significant time in the stroller. The seat pad did increase her comfort level but she still grows tired of the volo much more quickly than her larger stroller. I think this has to do with the fact that she is not very upright in the volo and cannot shift much in the seat as it offers no support. On top of it, the velcro on the seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold the stroller - a minor annoyance but a hassle all the same. The awning offers very little sun protection. The mesh cargo area holds very little and is difficult to access. On top of that, you need to empty it completely in order to fold the stroller.When it comes to travel the volo leaves much to be desired. With limited cargo room, it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything on the handles. It has no recline making it difficult for children to sleep well - a problem when you want to spend the day wandering. Further, while it is great to have such a lightweight stroller when getting it in and out of the car, riding escalators and getting on and off the bus, the Volo flounders once you get off well-paved surfaces. We encountered potholes, dirt paths, cobblestones and sand in our tavels and the Volo was a disaster. The wheels would spin erratically and catch in large divets and gutters. Locking the front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief. Cobblestones were particularly disastrous as the stroller was so hard to manage and such an uncomfortable ride that we ended up carrying both the child and the volo.If I had to do it over, I would opt for a compact stroller that weighs a bit more but offers larger wheels, easy-access storage and a supported reclining seat",United States,WI

However, once I received the bumper, I realized it clearly does not work with cribs with a solid headboard.  Upon writing customer service at breathable baby for advice on how it would fit, I was told the following:""The Breathable Bumper will wrap if your crib has a space on either side of the corner posts. If it does, wrap around the outside of the posts. If the Breathable Bumper won't fit your crib you should try the CribShield which has four separate pieces so you can eliminate the foot and head board pieces and just use the long rail sides. Look online and see that the crib must have straight railings and not too thick so the padded rail cover can fit and attach over it."" When I responded that this information was basically too little too late, and that it disagreed with what they said in their FAQ's, I was then told:""The other option moms have been doing is buying 2 Breathable Bumpers and using the short pieces on front and back rails. This way they have the padding. In the future, we will be selling them as a package that way, but for now you can still have the safety and comfort you desire.""I think it's really poor customer service to mislead the customer into buying an item and then tell them in order to make it work, they need to purchase a different item or more of the same.

Initially it looked great, seemed very sturdy and we thought he would love being able to sit and play with his toys.  However, getting him in and out we noticed that the plastic edges around where his legs go is actually very sharp, and as our baby is on the tall end of the spectrum, it was impossible to get him in and out of the seat without scraping up his little legs and knees. It's not as if he is going to get any shorter, so I don't think there is any solution to the problem.  I think Safety 1st could have done a better job of making the plastic in that area more comfortable, or even put some padding at that location.  I'm surprised more reviewers didn't have this problem.  For our baby, who normally loves bathtime, it was a painful and frightening experience.We will be returning the item.

As most parents can imagine knowing your going to be a first time mom, can be a very very exciting feeling.When we recieved our dresser, we did not open it right away. Once we decided to get the nursery together and my husband opened the box, to our surprise the right side panel was completely split in half. We called stork craft and reordered the part. The representative advised us that the part will take 2 weeks before it can be shipped to us. My husband and I wait a little more than 2 weeks and still no right side panel. I then called again and the same representative stated that it will take another 2-3 weeks before the package can be shipped. That same day I called Amazon and before the week was over we had a brand new dresser delivered to our house.

Unless you have lots of space between your cabinet and your oven unit you will have trouble even getting this thing to stick.I finally fenagled it into place, sticking the first piece to the side of the oven, then applied the part that goes across the front and latched it in place.  Upon opening the oven door with very, very, very little force (I just barely cracked the door open) the latch teeth snapped open, as if the latch wasn't even there.  Tried several times, even sort of holding the teeth, and no luck.  In the trash it went.I also tried another lock also from Safety first that seems like it would work great - it has a heavy duty hinge, but the half of the lock with the adhesive surface too short so that there is not enough length on the adhesive edge to adequately anchor it to your oven and still have the hinge lock in place - and the hinge locks in place at less than a 90 degree angle.  So this left the latch anchored with only about 1/4"" of the adhesive strip on the oven.  Pop - off it came when I tried to open the door.  In the trash it went as well.I'm very concerned about oven safety for my little guy and completely disappointed in the options out there for ovens.  :",United States,NC

From infant stage to now 6 months old, my daughter has fit snugly.  As an infant, the sling is perfect because you can't immerse the baby while the stump is still attached.  We used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink, which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage.  Once her stump fell off, and she was able to control her head well, we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby's bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub.  A perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath.  This is the position in which we currently use our tub.  Now, however, we bathe her in the Aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we don't have to worry about where the water lands.  Finally, once baby is old enough to sit without support, we'll remove the sling altogether and let her sit in the wide end of the tub to play during bath time.

The reviews didn't lie.  This monitor does great on distance.  I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors.  The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor.  I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound.  I could hear him grunt even!  I don't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss.  You're given many channels in order to find the right strength.  I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal (he was on opposite end of house upstairs).  I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times, not getting it soaked.  Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound (no radio or tv or mobile playing).  Great product, strongly recommend.  My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great.  This monitor is the right choice for the average household.  Interference may come if you're on the same channel.

Altman ""gocheapbooks""",suburbs of new york city,"ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional? Well, pretty much everyone i know, and they are all right of course.  Each baby is exceptional, in their own way.  But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians, nurses and early childhood educators?  Well, I know one - MINE!  I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant.  One time when using it, he started knocking back. Yeap, i actually felt him knock back at it, in rhythm.  It only happened once, but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid.  I was about 7 months pregnant then.  Well, lo and behold, after he was born people (professionals) don't stop telling us how amazing he is.  He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet.  He is 2 months old now, and has been sleeping through the night (11 hours at a time) since he was 2 weeks.  He cries when he needs something, and never cries for no reason (but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don't know how much that has to do with it.).  Yesterday he started reaching for objects.  Can't quite grab them yet, but it doesn't stop him from trying. The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is, how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age.  He's been holding his head up since the day he was born (3 days late) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks.  So, i don't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it.  I mean it could be just an accident but... all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children.

Newborns especially need a very soft surface for their very soft and malleable skulls.  We used it for our third baby and as a result, he has a perfectly round head and proportioned features.  The incline greatly reduced spit up as the 'flap' between their esophagus and stomach is not developed yet.  Gravity prevents the milk/formula from traveling back up and causing gas and or spit up.  I've noticed the biggest complaint about this item is that infants seem to slip down in it during the night.  This is true, however, rolling up a receiving blanket real tight and placing it in a ""U"" shape under our son's bottom prevented this from happening ever again.  As a result, he slept soundly, never spit up once, never woke us up with gas pain and has a perfectly round head.  I strongly recommend the Boppy Noggin Nest as well to keep the pressure off the head when your baby is not in his crib.  Also, if your baby is old enough to roll over, this item is not for you.  One other note: the foam wedges on either side do trap some body heat, so don't over-swaddle or put too many layers on...adjust the thickness of your blanket to the ambient temperature.  I would say this is a good item for newborns to about 5 months. It made an enourmous difference in the well being of our third child compared to his older twin siblings",United States,NJ

My first impressions is that a pressure mounted gate is fine for the bottom of stairs.  However, gates which attach to walls with screws are way more sturdy than even the best pressure mounted alternative.  We considered this model and the Evenflo ""Top of Stair Gate"".  After inspecting both gates in the store we opted for this one because the wood spindles on the Evenflo seemeed less sturdy and potentially prone to breaking.  If one of the spindles breaks you have to replace the entire unit.  Also, why take the chance with safety?   Anyway, here are a few things to consider when installing this item: 1. I took the advice of others and only used the template for the swing side hardware only.  This is a must do.  It would be a wall-damaging crapshoot to try to get both sides lined up exactly right using templates on both sides of the wall.  2. Unless you are screwing the hardward into a banister and don't want to damage them by having screws go all the way through, use longer screws than the dinky 1/4"" to 1/2"" screws that are provided in the kit.  I went with 2"" screws for additional strength.  3) Installation isn't that big of a deal.  Just take your time to avoid silly mistakes that result in extra holes in your walls.  I found the picture-based instructions at the back of the booklet far more useful than the word-based instructions at the front of the booklet.  It wasn't a five minute job but it was not hard at all.  I'll be back in a few months to post my thoughts on the gate after it has had some wear and tear from our 11 months old son and our 100lb dog.

My brother would also use the carrier and he claims the support was fine for him.  I would say if you have back problems think hard about this purchase, if you don't go ahead.

It's extension are screwed together and have an overlap. So the gate is not actually straight across.  We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates.  Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall.  Took us over an hour.     The Configure gate is on the pricey side.  We almost did not buy it.  But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need.  We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs.     It was so easy to add the extension piece on.  You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece.  You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening.     To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on.  It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes.  It was very sturdy.

She is the most rambunctious little girl too. And she is only 10 months old. She is already running around and able to walk really well on her own. And she loves the stairs. This gate is perfect in front of our stairs and they're not even with the wall either. The banaster and the very top stair are totally uneven and our opening is about 7 feet wide. And with the Configure Gate and one extension, there is no way I will ever have to worry about my daughter falling down the staris or breaking our gates, which she has done due to the way the top of our stairs are. This is the only gate that I have found that works perfect for our home. Plus the door in the gate is easy to use. You don't have to squeeze hard on the handle to open it, but it's not easy enough for a 4 year old to squeeze the handle. I love that this is a heavy-duty metal gate, it won't break or fall apart on me and it was easy to install. I'm so happy that my husband and I bought this gate. It is an all around Great Investment. If you are considering buying a baby gate, you should really invest in a great baby gate. And I HIGHLY recommend this gate. And with the extensions it can fit ANYWHERE in your home or you can make it into a circle for a play yard. If you want a gate for your home, and you want one that will last and protect your child no matter how hard they are on it, get this gate",United States,AK

But, nothing compared to giving her snacks in an open bowl. I've only used them on Cheerios so I can't comment on other snacks (she tends to choke on Goldfish so she only gets those while sitting in the high chair).She hasn't tried taking off the lid like other reviewers, so that's not a problem for us (at least not yet).

Both my husband and I use New Native slings on a daily basis. We've been 'wearing' our daughter since day one and continue to now that she is three months. This helped me tremendously in getting to 'know' my baby. It allows me to be responsive immediately to her needs because I can read her cues before she gets to a full blown cry. It helps me accomplish tasks around the house and makes shopping/running errands easy. We do not even own the detachable infant carseats. I cannot imagine having to lug one of those things around! I feel like this had helped her transition from her womb environment to the outside world. It gives her a sense of security even in new situations. Unlike front facing carriers, she can turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated. There are endless benefits to 'wearing' your baby and I feel like this sling has made it incredibly easy for me and my husband to do so. There are no buckles or rings or fasteners, just slide it on. If at first you don't succeed, try again later. It may be more comfortable for you and baby at a different stage. Another tip, get moving! The motion is what soothes babies and brings them comfort. Again, baby wearing is such a wonderful thing. I suggest you read up on the benefits and find a sling/carrier that works well for you.

B000I5UZ1Q,Fisher-Price Starlight Papasan Cradle Swing: Baby,baby,5 of 5,4.0,Baby and I like this Swing,"January 25, 2007",elviswoman,"Dallas, TX United States","I recently received this swing as a gift for my 2 month old preemie.  She LOVES the lights, the rotating stuffed animals, and the sounds.  And she seems comfortable in the seat too.  The seat snaps into two positions, a reclined position and a sitting position.  Additionally, you can set the swing up to go from side to side or forward and backward.I did have an incident last week where we had some power surges here in the neighborhood WHILE we were using this swing.   When the power came back on, I tried all the different switches to turn it on and it didn't work, then later on, it finally did work.  This swing has so many switches on it and I admit to being too lazy to read the instructions for all of the functions that each of the switches perform.  That said, I don't know if the failure was user error or a quality issue.  It appears to be functioning just fine as of this writing so I think it was me.Another user cites instability of the stand on this swing.  I have had no problem with this as I tested it carefully before putting baby in.  Also, we leave the swing set up in one place in our house all the time, so we haven't had have to worry about not opening the stand up all the way beyond the initial setup.  This might be more of a concern for someone who needs to put it away and take it back out a lot.I personally like the fact that the mobile, the rocking, and the sounds are independent of each other, so you have a lot of variety to entertain baby with.  I LOVE the fact that you can use batteries OR the wall outlet to power this thing.  Thank GOODNESS for not being held hostage to battery manufacturers anymore, but having that option if we wanted to use it where electricity isn't available.I would recommend this swing, but I would check for a reasonable return policy first before buying and keep the packaging for a couple of weeks after you receive it just to be sure you and your baby are happy with it",United States,TX

Langley,"San Jose, CA USA","We received the original co-sleeper as a gift.  We also considered getting a mini co-sleeper and a pack'n'play or similar playard.The main advantage of the co-sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up.  The original co-sleeper can also be used as a playard.  The playard capacity is up to 50 pounds, most brands are only rated to 30 lb.  Similarly the bassinet level rating is 30 lb. and most brands go to 15.  The co-sleeper itself is about 2 or 3 pounds heavier than a typical playard.  The width is 28"" so the co-sleeper can go through our 29"" doorways without collapsing, unlike several playards that are around 31"".There is a trick to collapsing the top bars - you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons, then it's easy.  (otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens)  This is explained on their website and SHOULD have been included in the manual.I had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad I chose to keep the co-sleeper and expect it to use it constantly.  Also, the Arm's Reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and I'm confident it'll keep the cats out",United States,CA

The seat part itself comes off to use on a regular toilet, and has handles for the child to steady him/herself.  The bowl insert is large and removes easily for cleaning.

O'Brien ""Kathryn's Mom""","Spencer, MA","I recently purchased the Zooper Tango Sidy by Side Double Stroller.  I had done some looking at stores & extensive research online.  Suddenly, I found this on Amazon of all places.  The reviews were great & the price was right.  I bought it, a little hesitant that I hadn't gotten to test drive it.  This stroller is great!  It fits through doorways, it's a little tight in an aisle, but we're talking about a double stroller here, it's going to be a little wide!  I have a 2 year old & 1 year old, so I do find that it veers to the side that my 2 year old sits on, just slightly.  It is heavier than the Peg Perego Aria is, but it feels much more solid.  Folds easily & somewhat compactly (again, it's a double stroller!).  It fits into the back of my Honda Odyssey with room for bags & whatnot.I would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or 2 little ones.  My 2 year old likes to ""nap"" (recline the seat) while we are walking.  The back zips off, she likes to look out the back.  A 5 point harness keeps everyone safe, but I find that I usually just use it as a waist seat belt.  Storage is limited, my husband wants to customize the basket area - it sounded like his plans involved a hack saw...There is a spot for a bottle of water or misc items (a hanging net type basket - just big enough for a bottle of water) & a zip pocket on the back of the stroller.  However, if you unzip the back & remove it, you have lost this pocket.  I did read that McClaren has a stroller organizer for about [...] - we were planning on buying this to carry more stuff.Overall, I do love our new stroller & would highly recommend it!",United States,MA

I just wanted something simple and strong that can get us out of the house quickly--we live in a very hilly, sort of rustic area, so I needed something I could take my son to the park in without hauling out the big buggy. This is really light, and it folds and has a carrying strap in case the boy wants to walk a bit. (There is also a storage bag for travel.) The tires have treads on them, so they can handle steep terrain, and they give a pretty smooth ride over bumps. The fabric is sort of a thick canvas-sy polyester--not removable, but it seems like it could easily be scrubbed/hosed clean if necessary. The seat also has some padding and back support (although, on the con side, it's probably not the coolest compared to mesh). The weight limit is given as 37 lbs, so my 19-month old still has plenty of room to grow--his shoulders are comfortable and his feet don't reach the footrest yet (he is 27 pounds and about 33 inches tall). On the plus side, it seems bigger than the Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller, plus it reclines a bit (you unzip/unbutton the sides to allow the fabric to unfold), unlike the Volo. The square canopy is maybe not the greatest (it only covers the face, and could actually sit a little higher I think)--but as for everyone complaining that it falls off, I have found that when you flip the canopy to the back, if you then detach the back flap from the seat, you can  attach the side flaps to that velcro on the back to keep it from sliding off. Some people have also mentioned kicking the wheels, but I'm 5'6"" and haven't had any problems--I think it's a matter of not standing right on top of the thing since it's an umbrella stroller and doesn't have a superwide wheelbase. I would give it 4.5 stars I think, but am giving 5 because of the great price! I'm pretty happy with this--and my son is constantly trying to climb in, so he must like it too... I figure that with the money we saved, we can buy a nice Kettrike or some other form of transportation the boy can grow into.",United States,CA

We've never used the rain cover, so I can't comment on that.  It doesn't have a storage basket, but I don't know many umbrella strollers that do.  For longer trips, we just take our full size Combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option.

You have to make sure that it is on securely with the lip in the front against the front of the seat. Otherwise it will fold, which is probably what happened to the other reviewer.

My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms.While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe. I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow.I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one.Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby. We've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally. We've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face. So after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks from day one",United States,IL

Watch for different size flanges.,"September 18, 2006",San Jose Mom,"San Jose, CA United States","I got this pump as a hand-me-down from my friend. It worked great even after many years... I eventually purchased the Pump In Style Advanced Limited Edition where the pump can be separated from the bag. It takes up less desk space (no extra space required for the bag). Also, it's more portable if all you need is the pump. I pump all over the house (study, bedroom, living room while watching TV with my husband).Just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the Medelas... It may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges. Every woman's breast and nipples are different sizes. Initially, I was using the standard 24mm flanges (suction cup things that go over your breasts). It was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though I was engorged with plenty of milk. It would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk! I went to see a lactation consultant who suggested I try the next size up flanges (27mm). She got me one to try and it made a world of difference. I could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins. Now, I pump daily to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins (estimate since I don't really time it cause it's so fast).I am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank. This pump made a world of difference.  I think Medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes. The standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps, the 27mm and a 30mm.",United States,CA

B000BMBU7O,Baby Trend Baby Trend Flex Loc Infant Car Seat - Chatham: Baby,baby,21 of 21,5.0,Superbly designed car seat!,"January 11, 2007",A. Larsen,"Blacksburg, VA","I don't generally write reviews but wanted to praise Baby Trend on the design of this car seat.  We were directed to it after the January 07 Consumer Reports review showing this as one of only two infant car seats to pass their more stringent crash tests (TV news showed alarming video of various car seats flying around the passenger compartment after being struck by a vehicle).Compared to our still-new Safety 1st seat, this one is so much better engineered in a number of ways:1) The base is super easy to install.  Click twice into each of the car's two anchor points, then tug on each of the two straps to tighten the base.  That's it.  Our old seat had paragraphs of confusing directions that didn't leave me as confident as this one.    2) The base has an easily adjustable tilting mechanism and leveling indicator to insure you get the right angle for the baby's head (no flopping).  Our old seat had no such system - we used rolled-up towels.    3) The seat has a dial to quickly adjust the seat height as the baby grows.  No such system on our old seat.    4) The handle has an ergonomic triangle shape on top for more secure grasp when reaching into the car from the left or right.    5) If the base is not available, the seat can be strapped directly into a car using the car's lap belt.    6) The seat is overall more narrow than our old seat, allowing our two other kids to fit in the back seat with a little more breathing room.  Every inch helps.    7) The seat is lighter than our old seat, although it feels just as secure  and solid as the old one.    All this, and the seat is the same price as our old one.  Unfortunately Amazon/Target was sold out when the Consumer Reports issue came out, but I found them in stock online at Wally World, if you are looking to get one quickly.  The one for sale here is a better color combo than Wally's, unless you like lime green - but the seats themselves are all the same superb design.Summary: super easy to install and adjust, well thought-out features, fair price!

Since my son was 3 months old we've turned it on every night at bedtime for him. He just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays. My son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it.  And the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it.  If I switch it to manual MODE, he can turn on the music himself!  He can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material. Plus, he has another friend to keep him company in his crib (a big happy turtle with fish in his belly :-). Thus far, the straps haven't broken or cracked and I have removed it from the crib a couple of times. Also, the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes.

However, it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees.

I never have problems with the bottle floating.  If you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to, then the bottle won't float.  The warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting.

Although my daughter is two and a half now, I would recommend the Playtex nursers to everyone!  They are sanitary and do cause less gas than conventional bottles.  I definitely like the Drop-Ins liners better than the traditional ones...  from a convenience standpoint, paired with the fact that they work so well with the breast milk storage system.I'm not planning on any more children, but I don't dare part with these bottles yet.

After working in daycare and as a nanny, I had a preference for these.  Then after my sister had my nephew and used them I knew the minute I found out I was expecting that I would be using them too.  The reason that I love these bottles so much is that they are very easy for baby to latch onto.  Most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use a nipple that is quite large, more like a breast.  If you think about how a woman's body is made and really look at the nipples you will see what I mean.  Being able to latch on better allows them to eat better and have much less gas and spit up.I also love how easy they are to warm up in a bottle warmer or crock pot.  Because they use the liner, the milk can heat up much quicker than a standard bottle with thick plastic - a very important thought at 3AM!!!Some people think having to always by liners is costly an annoying.  But not really.  100 eight ounce liners will cost about $8 and will last about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks.  So not as bad as you might think.  (If this is truly an issue for you, consider the Advent bottles.  They also have relatively large nipples.  But because they do not use a liner, you cannot eliminate the air from the bottle and they take much longer to warm up.) ",United States,NC

I had intended to only breastfeed for the first year, but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on. So much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week. The pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up. I chose the Premium Nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding. My daughter took well to the bottles, and even started latching on better when I did breast feed. I'm continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever. When people ask me if I breastfeed or bottlefeed my baby, I say ""both"", and they tell me how lucky I am! These bottles are a life-saver! They're easy to clean (I use the top rack of the dishwasher), and my baby hasn't had any problems with colic. I like the convenience of the disposable bags, too.

As the product name suggests, my son fits snugly and comfortably into the seat.The only problem that I have is with the process for adjusting the harness.  The buckles to do so are at the back of the seat and do not allow the harness straps to move easily.

B0002JA4XC,The First Years - Fold-Down Double Bedrail: Baby,baby,1 of 1,4.0,A good choice for 2 sided protection after a comparison with 3 other bed rails,"April 7, 2007",A. Bucci,"Houston, TX USA","Due to the room layout, I needed a double bed rail that would protect both sides of the bed.  We don't live near a store that has a lot of choices and after reading many online product descriptions decided that we were going to need to look at several of these ""in person"" and then decide which one best fit our needs.  So we purchased 4 brands of bed rails.After looking at the more detailed information on the box and trying two of them out, we decided to keep the Safe and Secure Double Bedrail by the First Years.To help others, I have attached two customer's photos to this product description.  These photos are sketches and photos from the side of the box that better describe the bed rail.  Why amazon/Target can't get a least as much information on their website than is on the side of the box is frustrating to me.  But that seems to happen many times.  This bedrail took about 30 minutes to assemble the side panels and another 45 minutes to fully assemble the unit to the bed.  This is in line with the time that the other model we tried out took.  The reasons why we liked this bed rail the best are as follows:(1)It is a double bed rail and is designed to protect both sides of the bed.(2)This was the only model we looked at where both sides folded down making mattress pad and sheet changes feasible.  (3)The quality of the construction (especially of the spring loaded Locking Pins) was much better than that of the Sleeptite bed rail we looked at from Regalo and One Step Ahead (which is also made by Regalo.)(4)The design made more sense than the Regalo.   The installation was more straightforward.  Possible issues with this bed rail are as follows:(1)It is only 17"" high, so measure your mattress and make sure that it will fit.  In our case, our mattress was not a pillowtop and is about 10-11"" high, depending on where you measure it.  So we were still satisfied with the height of the rail above our mattress.   But I could see where if you had a tall mattress this would be an issue.(2)This was the easiest rail to pull up to unlock and fold down.   Others had more substantial locking mechanisms.   I could see where a toddler who watched you do this, could then do it himself.  So we are planning on not doing this in front of our toddler, only during sheet changes.   Only you know how inquisitive your own child is about these things and how much of a problem this would be.  Despite these two issues, we decided that the good points outweighed the bad and that this bedrail was the best choice for us.  However, if we are later disappointed with this bed rail, I will go and update our review.   ",United States,TX

Since it's impossible to hold a baby all night and laying next to me on his side was a ""No, No"" for SIDS, I was looking for something that could help me get him to sleep in his bassinet on his back as is suggested to prevent SIDS.  I had tried swaddling my baby in blankets, but after a few weeks he had figured out how to get out of it.  I also didn't like that he could undo the blanket and it was loose around his face, another ""no, no"" for SIDS. So I bought these swaddle Me blankets that fasten easily with velcro.  And shortly after we started using the Swaddle me's, he started sleeping through the night, occasionally waking up for a 15 minute feeding (which I keep him swaddled for) and then he falls right back to sleep and I carefully pick him up and put him back in the bassinett for the rest of the night.

The first one I bought many years ago when the superyard was made with protruding metal hinges which were somewhat hazardous and invited mouthing by little teethers.

Great for blocking off the Christmas tree or any other part of the house. Cruising babies love to go round and round the inside and you can hang a busy box or other toys on the side to amuse a crawling baby. During football season, my friends and I take our superyards to tailgate and join them together to make a super superyard, so all the toddlers can safely play together. It's easy to clean using the pressure nozzle on the hose outdoors. Minor drawback is that it can be scooted across the floor or climbed out of by a determined toddler. Do I really need to say that any play yard should always be used only under adult supervision? Final comment - one of the most useful pieces of child-care equipment I've ever owned.

Margewicz ""Research nerd""",Florida,"I love this stroller, and tell all of my friends about it. Our daughter was about 3 months old when I purchased it. There was not a better rated stroller available when I researched, and there still is not. You can run, walk or rollerblade behind this stroller and feel confident that your child is safe. Lilyana is now 4 1/2 months and loves going for our daily walks, and occasional rollerblading.She is a fussy girl, (only) when it comes to being strapped down in the carseat, but loves the comfort and hammock like feel of BOB. We live in Florida, and with the sun-guard canopy, she is well covered.Some other factors which made we chose BOB:* The braking mechanism, which is hard to find, has a wrist strap which if you should fall, locks the back wheels (unlike most strollers on the market). This feature is great for rollerbladers.* 5 point safety harness* 70 pound weight limit (highest that I found)* Metal frame (others have more plastic that metal)* Shock absorbers, great of rocking/bouncing her to sleep* Swivel front wheel, which locks with a simple pin.* Simple Lily likes it, and we tried several others, all that Babies-R-Us has in stock.The cost is pretty high, but would you put a price on the safety of your child, if you were to fall while exercising?Thanks for hearing me out",Uruguay,Florida

I was looking for a stroller that wouldn't make my older daughter feel like ""a baby,"" but gave her the option of sitting during long trips to the mall, zoo, park, etc.  This stroller was the answer!The front seat is perfect for our little one.  The tray swings open (and comes completely off, if needed) to get her in and out easily.

She walks with us and then easily climbs onto her seat when she wants to take a break.The parent tray is great and something I really missed on our last double stroller.

B000056OUH,Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer: Baby,baby,2 of 4,5.0,Sterilising is important to protect your baby,"February 13, 2007",L. Mcallister,"Bethesda, MD, USA","I have used this product with all three of my children and it has been great. Easy to use and quick to sterilise.With regard to previous comments about not sterlising equipment, I should point out that there is a difference between clean and sterile. All babies are vulnerable to the germs that cause diarrhoea and vomiting, and so it is best to continue sterilising bottles and teats (and breast pump equipment) until your baby is one year old and has built up more resistance to bacteria generally. Cleaning your baby's bottles and teats in a dishwasher will not always heat them to the right temperature to kill off all known bugs, so it's generally still advisable to sterilise after washing. If you do want to rely on your dishwasher alone, it needs to be run on a hot programme at a minimum temperature of 80 degrees centigrade. The bottles then need be filled with feed straight away as the dishwasher will not leave them in a completely sterile condition. It may seem pointless to sterilise feeding equipment when your baby is crawling around the floor and putting all sorts of things in his mouth, but the bugs that stick to milk curds can be dangerous. Your baby's immune system will grow stronger into the second year and he'll be able to combat infections more easily.

She's in a toddler bed now, and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she's not supposed to! This is a great device and everyone should have one.

We've been using it for a few weeks now and it's gone off twice - scaring us, but making us glad that we have it.  Both times that its gone off, our daughter has been very tightly swaddled, so we think that made her breathing shallow and thus set off the alarm.  You can change the sensitivity on it, but the default setting should be fine.  There is a bit of background noise or static that you can hear.  My husband solved that issue by placing a piece of regular household tape on the bottom few speaker holes.  It is still loud enough for us to hear her without the extra noise.  It does take some getting used to - you have to turn off the sensor and put it in sound only mode whenever you remove the baby from the crib, otherwise the sensor will go off.  But this `inconvenience' is totally worth the peace of mind this sensor gives you.  I believe they sell this with only one parent unit - but you really want to get two.  Leave one in the bedroom and keep the other mobile - we constantly move the second from the kitchen to the bonus room, to the living room, etc.  This sensor is an amazing product and worth every penny.",United States,NC

It helped that the potty was really comfortable, with a wide, flat bottom that left no marks on her tush, and stable enough so there were no accidents. I only give it 4 stars because I really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky. Ah, and the music never worked (no loss in my opinion, I was there to do the encouraging) and the training book seemed a bit cheesy. A toddler may also entertain thoughts of removing the easily accessible container while sitting, which may lead to a whole new set of problems. But overall, this potty has made our lives so easy during potty training, that I cannot but lavish praise over this little piece of plastic",United States,CA

No matter how fretful his mewling, when we swaddled him and placed him in this sling, he would fall asleep. Because he otherwise rarely slept in those early weeks, he spent a good deal of time in it.  Three aspects of the design are great: 1. The bottom is padded so you can lay baby on a hard surface and use sling as a changing pad; 2. The sides are high and have drawstrings that allow the sling to be opened up almost flat; 3. It grows with your baby--my tiny baby hated the front-type Bjorn carriers, but loved this and still likes it.  One aspect of the design is, to me, dreadful--the shoulder strap! It should be wider and padded.  I tried repositioning it every which way and no matter what I did, the strap dug into my shoulder.

He was fine, but we were all shaken up! If we'd had our (familiar) floppy Seat cover, we would have been able to help our son a few moments faster. Every second counts!",United States,CA

B000BMJ1CA,Graco Family Tree Play Yard: Baby,baby,32 of 32,5.0,Worth the Price,"November 25, 2006","J. Weaver ""New Mommy""","Beaumont,  CA","This Graco Family Tree Play Yard is perfect for newborns. The setup isn't quite as easy as the description implies, simply because the instructions are all pictures, without corresponding written directions. That said, a little patience the first time around makes setting up and putting away the play yard incredibly easy afterward.The quilted mattress pad serves double duty to wrap around the folded up play yard when you need to take it on the go. I find this especially convenient because it guarantees that I won't leave an essential piece at home when I take the yard with me.The description is a bit in error in regards to the mobile and the music. An attachment that sits on the side of the yard has an incredible variety of settings for vibration, music/noise, and lighting. There are different timed settings you can use to help get baby to sleep. The music is NOT, however, directly attached to the mobile. Also, the mobile sits on its own; it does not turn. That bothered me at first, but I quickly got over it when I realized my newborn didn't seem to care anyway.The changing table sits higher than those on other play yards that I've seen, making diaper changes much easier on the back. The built in diaper holder and baby wipes holder are convenient for those rush changes. The changing table is padded and easy to clean up, though you need to use lap pads or something of that sort, as there isn't a removable pad on it. This is actually to my preference, as it's less stuff for my baby to have to contend with, but may be bothersome to parents who think their baby needs the extra cushioning.When taking this on the go, as I said, it's easy to pack up. One minor drawback is the travel bag that holds the play yard. It doesn't have a handle, and it doesn't fit all the components of the yard. The changing table and the mobile sit at home when I take this on the go. The reality is, if I'm travelling, it's more convenient to not have these extra pieces to worry about. However, I'm not sure how I'll pack them up when my baby outgrows the changing table and is just using the yard itself. I consider that a very minor consideration though.This play yard sits in my living room where it is incredibly convenient because it has space to hold all of my baby essentials so that I'm not having to constantly run to the nursery. I'm not sure what the parent organizers are intended to be for (they look like little soft-sided cup holders), but I've found them to be convenient places to store extra burp cloths, a pacifier, and socks that are just too little to stay together anywhere else.",United States,CA

The reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like Mommy and Daddy. We balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer. No more balancing acts on the toilet. She can use her step stool to get on the Toilet when she wants. The toilet trainer travels well, fits all types of toilets, easy to install, remove, and clean!

She quickly became too tall to use the stand alone potty seat, so I ordered this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer and it has been fantastic. She quickly learned how to put the seat on the toilet herself and adjust the wheel to make it snug. It was also easy for her to remove and hang on a small butterfly doorknob my husband attached to the side of the sink cabinet. The seat gave her a great sense of independence and allowed her to be comfortable and secure while learning to use the big potty. It is also great for traveling. I would put it in a zippered canvas tote and carry it with us into rest areas (it really does fit any toilet) - she could sit securely and be protected from unclean surfaces (I would carry a small container of Disinfectant wipes to clean her seat off each time we used it in a public restroom).

As a tension or pressure-mounted gate, I love this item. I have no problems stepping over it -- and I'm only 5' 5""-- so I never found it to be a nuisance. It's easy to use with one hand and snaps into place easily. It's also easy to adjust the size to fit different sized door openings, although that takes two hands. It's light enough that I can carry my 13-month old son on one arm and the gate in the other as I travel from floor to floor. My 2 year old is learning to sleep in a room by herself so we use the gate at the doorway so that she can call to us from her room without being free to wander into the hallway or onto the stairs.

These diaper covers are fantastic.  I have not had a single leak with them.

B000B90G9K,Summer Infant Mother's Touch Large Comfort Bather: Baby,baby,62 of 63,5.0,A tub seat that grows with your baby!,"February 1, 2006","Gillian Kies ""An Avid Reader""",Central Massachusetts,"My 4.5 month old son has never liked the plastic bathing tubs, so right from the very beginning, he's been in the big tub with a tub seat. He loved bath time until just a few weeks ago, when he outgrew our original Especially for Baby (the BRU ""house"" brand) tub seat. In desperation, we searched the shelves at BRU and settled on the Mother's Touch.I can't say enough good things about this tub seat. The head support features a soft washcloth-like insert to cushion a newborn's delicate head, and it can be repositioned or removed as the baby grows. The two-position back reclines for newborns, and sits up straighter for older babies. The entire seat is up high enough that quite a bit of water is needed in the tub, but I found that it makes it easier to control how deep my baby sits in the water (in the old tub seat, he had to be up to his ears in order to have enough water to bathe in). One of the things my son hated about his previous tub seat was that he couldn't sit up in it. The design of the Mother's Touch provides enough support to allow Baby to sit up mostly unassisted, and the ample padding makes sure he doesn't bruise himself on the hard edges. Even though there's lots of support and padding, it's still very important to closely supervise your baby when using this (or any) tub seat. Another reviewer mentioned a couple of things things that I'd like to respond to: *There are no suction cups on the base: I have found that the rubber grips provide more than enough traction, but tubs may vary. *She would like a strap: the seat that I have does have a strap (it's stored underneath the seat, so may not be immediately identifiable), so I wonder if the seat has been redesigned recently.Overall, my son and I are very happy with this tub seat, and I've been recommending it to friends. They'll have to buy it new instead of getting it as a hand-me-down, though. I foresee him being able to use it for most of his first year before he outgrows it!",United States,MA

Clark ""DC Sambista""","Washington, DC","I and my wife have been very pleased with the Jeep Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller.  Unlike the cheap umbrella stroller we used to have, this one has better construction for the main folding support tubes. Plus, the handles are longer which means I (5'-1'' guy) don't have to walk like a neanderthal to push my toddler. The wheels do work pretty well on most surfaces even in very light snow.  The brakes are durable plastic and should last longer than my previous stroller. The pouches are an added plus for storing snacks or bus passes. My only disappointment has been the sun screen. It is not that useful for blocking the sun from my son's eyes unless I pull it directly in front of him. At that point, he can't see anything. That's OK if he falls asleep, but otherwise he (an independent todler) will pull the sunscreen off if it blocks his view.An added bonus would be a shoulder strap that I could use to carry the stroller for walking more than a few feet. While it's light and compact for a stroller, it is still cumbersome to carry if you have to fold it on the bus or walk anywhere with it.

My son receives only breastmilk and this system has made it SO easy to express, store, and feed him with a bottle.I have not found the liner cost to be a problem.  Nor was I disturbed by how many kits I needed to buy.  I think I bought 5 or 6 to make sure I had enough.  It just depends on how much you're going to need to store.  But you don't need many actual bottles, since the milk doesn't have to be stored in them, so the price evened out for me.  Besides, it's much cheaper than buying formula!I also don't care about exact measurements of how much my son eats.  I can get the measurement just by lifting the liner out and taking a look.  But when he's at the breast, I don't know how much he's eaten, so I don't track just how much he has from the bottle, either.  I just make sure he has enough dirty diapers.I find the system easy to use because I can express directly into a liner, put the bottle into the freezer, then remove the liner from the bottle when it's frozen.  This reduces the space needed.  When it's feeding time, just pop one of them into a bottle, heat, and replace the cap with a nipple.  Easy!  ",United States,

I have been pumping exclusively for 4 months now and only found this about a month ago. Before this, I was pumping and storing in Medela bottles, then transferring to Playtex liners before feeding. Then I had to wash all the Medela bottles, plus Playtex rings, etc. With this system, I just pump right into the liners. They are so easy to just grab out of the fridge and go. I can warm a bottle with the car warmer using the self-contained liners, instead of having to bring a medela bottle to warm, PLUS a playtex system.Overall, this has saved me several steps and less things to wash. For the dad who said it threw off the ounce markers - that is true. However, the liners themselves have ounce markings on them. Just unscrew the top ring slightly so that the liner sinks back down and then read the ounce marker on the liner. Easy!I would not buy this system to use for storing frozen milk (if you store a lot of it). It would get too expensive for my tastes. I have two sets and that is perfect for refrigerator storage.

When my older daughter was ready for a booster, the choice was easy -- BRITAX!  My daughter loves her booster.  When I first got it in the mail (we live overseas) I was initially disappointed because I thought she wouldn't like the side supports, but she loves them! I would like to comment on two previous comments....boosters are not FAA approved and shouldn't be used on an airplane.  Boosters are for use with shoulder seatbelts.  Second, you do not secure a booster down because it is not a carseat.  It is used because children under 8 and 80 pounds are too small for a shoulder seatbelt.  I simply want to comment on those because Britax makes a great....and SAFE product",Japan,

B0001XLS84,Chicco Blue Sky Smart Support Backpack: Baby,baby,1 of 1,5.0,So glad I bought it!,"April 3, 2007","Yvonne M. Jones ""beyond normal""","Salinas, CA USA","I'm a mother of a 21-month-old. I just got a puppy and was having a hard time managing the stroller AND the leash on our walks. This backpack is perfect. It fits me well and my daughter loves it. She asks to stay in it when we're done! I was worried about that because she never liked any of the baby carriers I've tried before when she was younger. You do have to toughen up your shoulders (by taking shorter walks at first) before going on any long hikes, of course. I don't understand the chest problem on one of the other reviews, because the chest strap is adjustable, long, and sits just below the shoulders, avoiding the ""busty"" area very well. However, it does come out of the box at the shortest setting, so you have to loosen it to fit your frame. The question of being able to ""close"" the frame with the child in it doesn't seem to be an issue on mine. The stand part folds up easily under the child once the child is on your back. You do need long enough arms to grab it behind you, though. It makes no difference to you or the child if you leave the frame in the open position during your walk, but if you're in tight quarters, you'll want to close it. I did make the mistake of trying to put Aeryn's (my daughter's) feet behind me in the frame at first, which made her knees rest uncomfortably on the frame. The legs are supposed to go naturally forward toward either side of your waist. (The picture on the box helped me figure that out.) It is for kids from 6 months up to 36 months, and comes with a clear rain shield that easily zips onto the retractable sun shield. The rain shield is also helpful in windy conditions- my daughter thinks it's cool and leans over to fog it with her breath. It's not easy to do with a six-month-old puppy jumping around on you, but I've even managed to get into the straps and stand up from the floor with Aeryn in the pack (I'm reasonably fit, and she's just under 30 pounds). This thing is rugged, comfortable, good-looking, and has ""be prepared"" features like a cellphone holder and a matching fanny pack (that can be carried on the frame, if you'd rather)",United States,CA

I hike hills up to two hours with my seven month old (19 lbs) in the pack without problems.  The built in shade cover is great as you dont have to put it on and off as needed.  The pack is very comfortable for both of us.  The interior of the pack also adjusts for the baby size and as mine grows taller, I can drop him lower in the pack.

B0009F8RAQ,New Native Baby Carrier: Khaki Medium (chest size 34-37): Baby,baby,42 of 42,5.0,"After three babies, my original New Native sling is finally wearing out...","December 13, 2005",LeeAnn Balbirona,Washington state,"I received my original New Native sling as a baby shower gift back in 1997. I wore it nearly every day for 15 months and then again with babies #2 and #3. Now we are expecting our fourth baby and the fabric is a bit faded and worn (we have the purple one), so I thought it time to buy a second sling. The original is still good as far as the stitching goes and we'll still use it, but I'm a bit tired of the purple color after nine years! :) Pros: This sling is the smallest as far as packing it with you. It's a simple double band of fabric that can be folded up in your bag or purse easily. Men don't mind wearing it (at least my husband didn't), it comes in basic solid colors and doesn't scream ""baby!"" when you're out and about. Many people couldn't tell I was wearing the baby when she was little. It's a good place for the baby to nap and to cover you up a bit when you nurse, once you figure that out. It's more versatile than other types of baby carriers in that you can use it from newborn to toddler (I've even used it with two-year-olds for short periods when they are tired of walking and the stroller isn't an option). You can carry the baby on your front or back (with experience, this is doable, but mostly for older babies), on your hip (once your baby can sit strongly). It's also easy to throw in the wash when the baby's diaper inevitably leaks or spits up all over it. (No complicated latches, webbing or snaps to clean.)Cons: If you get the wrong size, the baby will hang too low and your back will hurt. My original is the Large size (based on chest measurements from the manufacturer) but I'm going to order a Medium this time. My husband still likes the Large, but he has a longer torso than I. Newborns may need some support in the New Native sling, otherwise you may feel they are swimming in the fabric. I always use a tightly rolled-up receiving blanket and place it in the sling first, then lay the baby's head and back on top of it. This pushes the baby up enough toward the opening so that you don't feel like she's lost in there. Usually I only do this for the first few weeks. After a while, your baby will be big enough to peek out on her own and wave at people.The trickiest thing with the New Native carrier is learning to sling the baby on your back, which enables you to do things like cooking and unloading the dryer while your baby sleeps. You have to put the baby in on your front first then shimmy the fabric around with the baby in it. If you can master this, the sling is ideal for the fussy baby or for all-day babywearing.Highly recommended! Good value for your money.",United States,WA

Our dear daughter suffered with severe GERD and would cry for hours. As soon as I placed her in the sling she would immediately relax. It was like magic and truly kept me sane.After doing some reading I found that this was not only great for colicky babies but was better for their spines than other types of carriers and so much easier to take with us. Our daughter loved to be held and this helped tremendously. When we go on trips I always take it with me as she is sure to tire of her stroller. She loves hanging out in the sling and it is very versatile. I recently tried one of those baby carriers that are like a backpack thing to take with us on a trip since our dear daughter has somewhat outgrown her old sling and hated it. Bought another new native and am thrilled. One of the absolute best purchases that I have made as far as baby gear goes.,United States,OH

I ordered it anyway, because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son. When it arrived (earlier than expected), I noticed that it was easy to assemble, and that because it is not made with very thick plastic, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training.  My son is 18 months old, and 22 lbs, and it is perfect for him, sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty.  He really enjoys climbing up himself, and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process.  I let him look at the box, and we talked about how the little girl was going potty, and he liked seeing the little girl on the box :) using the potty, ""just like him"".

Easy to install with the level indicator.  A few drawbacks:  Once my daughter was a few months old, it got really heavy to carry around.  She also outgrew it by 6 months.  The harness needs to be longer.  It doesn't release enough to get taller babies in and out comfortably.  And for some reason, the release levers to move the handle to get the baby in and out were really stiff and difficult to use.  My mother in law has arthritis and ended up having to either carry the carseat with both arms like a bundle of wood (because she couldn't move the handle up) or try to slide my daughter out of the top or bottom (because she couldn't move the handle back).

B0002U1TRG,SnugRide Infant Car Seat - Windsor: Baby,baby,18 of 18,4.0,Good for small-to-average  babies and short-distance carrying,"April 15, 2006",Bortukan,"Chandler, AZ United States","Baby size: My daughter started out at just over 5 lbs, and this seat fit her well from the beginning.  The straps have adjusted easily as she's rapidly grown, I haven't had the adjustment problems other reviewers had.  The head support worked well too (at first we had to use a rolled towel inside it for her tiny head).  A baby's head will not fall forward as long as the seat is properly leveled according to the convenient indicator on the side of the seat, but if the angle is even slightly off this can happen easily.  The seat can only be leveled in the center seat of some sedan backseats (like my Toyota Camry) because of this angle requirement, but there are leveling accessories you can buy to help with this issue.  Portability: I love the stay-in-car base, which I found easy to install properly.  It's also very easy to snap the carrier portion in and out, and very obvious whether the carrier is secure or not.  An extra base is great for families with multiple cars, as either parent can quickly snap the seat in and go.  The carrier portion is convenient for quick trips in and out of the car, but I find it much too heavy to comfortably carry long distances with a baby over 10 lbs (and I'm fairly strong).  It will not fit securely enough for my taste in the child seat portion of a grocery cart, but it does fit well when placed sideways across the larger basket portion; I just stash groceries in the large space left underneath the carrier and in the rest of the basket.  The Snap n' Go stroller is great if you're taking this seat farther from your car.  It's much more lightweight than the large ""travel system"" Graco also sells with this seat.  It's easy to maneuver and comfortable for most people to push, but a little too short if you're much taller than 6 ft.Durability: I can't comment on the seat's lifespan, as we've only been using it a little over 2 months.  A few times I have noticed the sticking carrier handle other reviewers mentioned, but it doesn't happen often.  The canopy seems rather flimsy to me, but we only use it occasionally when using the stroller, so it hasn't been an issue so far.Other considerations: Windsor seems to be a fairly gender-neutral pattern, if this matters to you.  My baby wears a lot of yellow clothes, and people seem to assume she's a boy about 60% of the time when she's in this seat.  The carrier handle has several different positions: up for carrying, flat for carseat use, and down for resting the carrier portion on a flat surface without letting it wobble.  With the handle left up, the ""wobble-enabled"" carrier portion can be rocked slightly on the floor to stall a fussy baby as you try to finish an errand before she erupts.I would buy this seat again.  Its only drawbacks are its weight (probably unavoidable since it's a carseat and must be sturdy) and the rather stringent placement requirement for leveling (but at least the indicator lets you know about this problem)",United States,AZ

Little did I know, I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it's warming capabilities. After a few months under their belt, babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night, so blankets are useless (and dangerous).  So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm, even after the risk of SIDS passed. They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months, and they're generous in size, so they are not outgrown easily. I only wish I'd purchased them in yellow or white, in case my next baby is the opposite sex",Eire,Baile Átha Cliath

I love them and they make the room look great.  We also were presented with the problem of how to hang them.  There is what seems to be a dowel pocket in the back, but that seemed too complicated to deal with.  Therefore, my husband and I attached a safty pin to the back of each square in the center at the top.  My husband then used a finish nail in the wall, and used the safty pin to hang over the nail.  The pin is low enough so you do not see it or the nail the square is hanging on. It was easy to do, and the wall hangings look great!  I thought there would be a problem with getting them to be straight, but they are light enough to manipulate and stay where they are placed. I hope this helps others with this problem.

B000M4W7H8,BOB Revolution Duallie Jogging Stroller - Mesa Orange: Baby,baby,10 of 10,5.0,Worth EVERY cent!,"January 4, 2007",S. Boehmer,"Orange County, CA","I already have a single jogging stroller (not a BOB) and have been happy with it. We are in the process of adopting our second child, which we had less than 24 hours notice about, so a lot of money is going to legal costs, baby stuff, and my time off of work, and as a result I was concerned about spending this much on a stroller, but is was worth every cent. With the BOB Duallie, I am ecstatic, overjoyed, delighted, thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out. For my first trip out, I put my 2 year old and 11 week old in and went for a six mile walk. The trip was so smooth, both kids slept for most of the time. The seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat, no problems with his head bobbing around (pardon the pun). The shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride, which transits to less work for my arms. I didn't realize how much effort went into the other stroller, pushing it and turning it. The smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster, a plus when trying to lose weight.The stroller can turn in circles on itself, allowing for extremely sharp turns. Very nice, especially when inside a small store, like Starbucks. The windows up top are well placed enough that I can actually see my kid's face, not just their little bodies. The straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller I've used. There is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid's shoulders. The straps at the waist don't come out of the sides, (this is kinda hard to explain) the strap is attached in the center of the seat, and the sides come around the child, more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit. Even my 70 year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller. As for the Mesa Orange, it is more like a burnt orange, with brown trim and I am very glad I got it! It is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos. Be sure to get the tray, I forgot to order it with the stroller. The storage is a little shallow, but being double wide, there is still plenty of room for stuff.",United States,CA

It fits our large Britax Roundabout, plus has space for a bag of diapers, soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips.  We use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes. As our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane, we simply check it through as a piece of luggage.

B000067UXF,Tike Tech Double T Stroller - Blue: Baby,baby,10 of 10,4.0,great jogging/outdoor stroller!,"April 16, 2006",Emilie,New York,"I own a lot of strollers for my twin sons ((this one, the duoglider, two small single strollers, and a double umbrella stroller)) and I absolutely LOVE this one!First of all, if you want to be a satisfied customer you have to know what the purpose of the stroller is, which is for jogging, or maneuvering outdoors on rough terrain. My husband jogs with the stroller at least once a week ((and has no complaints)), but I on the other hand just adore it for the outdoors. The wheels go over almost any surface, including gravel, dirt, grass, concrete, brick, sand, boardwalk anything, I love it. The seats both fully recline ((individually)) and when they do, the rear of the seat is mesh so you can see your child from behind ((although you would most-likely have to bend down to get a good look)). The five-point harness on a jogger is a MUST HAVE, and this model even comes with comfortable pads as well. The basket is HUGE and holds everything we need for a day at the beach/park/walk around the block, which is very important to me. It is also removable, but I don't see why it would be advantageous to take it off. Plenty of other storage is available behind the seats as well, handy little pockets and pouches to store little knick-knacks. Considering the type of stroller it is, it folds very easily, and I can fit it in the rear of my minivan after removing the rear and front tires ((which is equally as easy to do, rear tires come off with the push of a button and the front has an easy to use release mechanism)). The canopy is enormous and proves for GREAT sun protection when needed! The breaks are FANTASTIC, and stop the stroller in its tracks which is very important if you are jogging, and need to stop quickly, according to my husband anyway. The included wind/rain shield is also very convenient ((can be left rolled up to the top of the canopy, incase there is a chance of rain you don't have to work for 5 minutes to attach it and get the kiddos wet)), but I do wish it also came with mesh covers for mosquitos and other bugs.I do dislike the fact that it is EXTREMELY difficult to turn ((although I have kind of gotten it down to a science, you need to be prepared for the turn and tilt the stroller a bit, the turn is very wide and not that smooth)). I think it would be better if it had a swivel wheel which had the option to lock in place for jogging ((a swivel wheel would actually be extremely dangerous if jogging as you could lose control of the stroller)), but that's just me personally. The baskets are near impossible to access if both seats are reclined all the way, and I have had to wake sleeping babies on a few occasions ((that's why I have learned to put things such as my cell phone and wallet in the canopy pouches, so I don't have to constantly go into the basket)). The canopy is quite large, and if you are not using it its quite a pain to retract as it doesn't go back neatly, and if its a windy day the canopy doesn't always stay up.If you are looking for a good stroller for outdoor use, and don't mind the large size or getting used to turning, then I highly recommend the Tike Tech",United States,NY

We needed the gate (which already came with one extension panel) plus one more extension panel (we purchased additional) for a total of 107 inches across.  It wasn't that horrible to install--just read the directions first and allot your self a couple of hours.  If you measure well and take your time, it's not that difficult.  Also best to attach it to a stud in the wall for xtra durability.As for durability, you need an adult sized hand to open this latch--my almost 5-yr-olds can't do it.  The extra foot adds stability.  The baby has tried many times to push it over or break through the latch and never succeeds.  We like that you can set it to swing only one way if you choose, since it prevents it from smacking into our dining room chairs.As for appearance, the neutral oak on this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things.  We've received many compliments on our wide spaces gate (and matching stairwell gates) from guests, and it only takes seconds to slide out of the wall brackets and store if we're entertaining company.I think some of the previous posters either had way too high expectations for a baby gate (it's not a brick wall!), or installed it wrong.  I would recommend this gate to anyone, especially those with multiples that need to gate off a portion of a large area to create a safe playspace",United States,FL

Anderson ""momof2""",oregon,"I bought this seat a couple weeks ago and my 2 month old nephew is using it when I have him until my son is born in June. I love the look, style and safety of this seat. The only thing that I thought may be a problem was the way the shoulder straps adjust height. My nephew is 22"" and he is almost on the second to last adjustment. Also the side impacts don't leave alot of room for a head positioner for newborns and they are far enough apart for the head to have room to wobble side to side. My nephew seems to love it though and seems really comfortable in it. The upright position is something I like, I have never seen him sweat in it, he seems to have growing room, the canopy covers him fine, and I think it is the most comfortable to carry. His parents are using an Eddie Bauer and I know alot of people (including me in the past) that use Graco and other brands and they seem roomier, but not as safe. Also I haven't seen a baby over 4-5 months in the infant seats anyways, I don't know anyone that would want to lug around a baby over 15 pounds in an infant seat, I guess that's just the few of us who aren't body builders. My nephew is 11 pounds now and he is getting pretty heavy in the seat, it's a good thing that the seat isn't too heavy itself. I would recommend this seat, but I can't explain the other reviews, so mabey trying it out in the store is best for everyone",United States,OR

They have helped prevent him from doing that any more.  However, if he's in the mood, he can easily dismantle the entire contraption - so it won't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to.  In fact, the two end panels had to be removed because he wouldn't leave them alone.  All in all though, I think the mesh ""bumpers"" do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys (and pluggers) in the crib instead of out on the floor",United States,TX

I like that it covers the entire side of the crib and doesn't come up only partway like a traditional bumper. Also, I like the breathable netting since baby can see out through it and since it ""gives"" a bit when baby pushes and kicks it. We have a nonstandard length crib (Babee Tenda), so we do have small gaps at each end of the rail, but we had read about this issue in another review from a Babee Tenda crib owner, so we knew up front we would have these gaps. These small gaps have not been a problem for us as our baby doesn't seem to want to stick her legs through the gaps in this location (I think it's difficult since she would have to lie almost flush with the headboard or footboard to do so). The white satin edge is very pleasant to look at. Overall I like this product much more than the traditional bumpers I have seen.",United States,CA

We would fold the top down before we swaddled our son in this so it wasn't as long.  At 3.5 months, our baby weighs 17 pounds so it's hard to find something to swaddle him with, and he still needs it.  I hope he doesn't outgrow this one in the near future.

Conrad ""Andy's Mom""","Atlanta, GA","We've had this bed rail for about two months now for our 3 1/2 year old on his full size ""big boy bed"".  We're quite satisfied with it.  Construction:  Very sturdy, our son jumps on his bed and rolls around and the bed rail stays put and does not seem like it could possibly give way.  The mesh is soft which is good for the times when he wedges himself in the corner to sleep.  We tug on it from time to time and it's not going anywhere.Assembly:  Not too easy, the instructions are horrible, but once you realize on your own how it's supposed to go, the actual assembly is OK, but not quick.  Very easy to adjust the width to your bed with the simple strap feature.  Hide away feature:  This is what took away the 5th star.  It's not very easy to unlock and push it under the bed. That feature works but requires some wrangling.  If you want the hide away feature for once in a while, I wouldn't let that stop you from buying it, if you plan to hide the rail daily, I don't recommend it for that.Making the bed:  Easy to tuck the sheets around it, no need to hide away or struggle.Overall, I would highly recommend this bed rail, I read all the reviews, and asked many friends, and this seemed to be the best in all areas, and a good value for the price, considering other can be well over $xx",United States,GA

BOB is very high quality and has held up extremely well for us after nearly 2 years of use. We're a little attached to BOB in our house. Let me tell you the Revolution is the stroller to get. We bought it right after our baby was born, choked up $40 or so for the infant seat bar and have used it as our primary stroller ever since. Even in the mall, department stores, etc it's great. Baby gets a smooth ride and daddy likes it because it's agile and almost effortless to push. I see hundreds of Bugaboo strollers around and I must admit they are nice but B.O.B is my choice because of price and you can go more places with him. Our other seldom used stroller is a Graco something or other and I don't even know where it is. However I've used it enough to compare it to BOB when collapsing it and putting it in the car. I must say BOB is easier and faster to fold and go.One downside might be that the storage compartment under the seat is smaller than some of those jumbo strollers. However, BOB is built like a tank. We travel with BOB a lot through airports (Yes BOB fits through most airport XRAY's while normally collapsed but sometimes I have to take off the back wheels which is easy) and we hang stuff off of BOB's handlebars and even carry our jumbo car seat on top of the sun shade until we get to our car.Our family is now looking for a double or tandem stroller. This get's interesting because I don't see us doing the duallie BOB Revolution since it's a no-go in the mall, Target, etc. The Phil & Ted's E3 Buggy and Double Buggy are looking tempting but I don't like that the older child sits tucked behind the stroller.. They can't see anything. What I wish B.O.B. Corp would do is come up with an attachment to at least do the same as the Phil & Ted's..... But a tandem stroller that was a revolution would be sweet!",United States,CA

He uses the handle to push the bus, flips up the shape sorter and kicks at the wheels to make the music come on.  It keeps his attention while he practices sitting up for long periods of time.We thought at first we had a broken one since only one light worked and it didn't flash.

It is the law in my state that children must in a booster or car seat until age 8. The seat material is high quality and the cushioning is very comfotable. The headrest is perfect for long trips since my son can fall asleep without an annoying crick in his neck. The price is decent too.The only issue I have with this seat is the cupholders. If you have a regular sedan and want to fit others in your car, the cupholders aren't very usable. Additionally, the cupholders don't slide out very well when the child is sitting in the seat. Personally, I leave the cupholders pushed in. I have another carseat for a young infant in my sedan and must fit my 10-year old in the back seat. I wish carseat and booster seat makers would instead make a mesh bag pocket hang right off the botton front for kid toys and such. Furthermore, with booster seats in general, I think they are very impractical for families who need to fit 3 kids across the backseat. My son has a very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach to the side where space is at a premium.I would love a forward-facing booster seat with a 5-point harness that would lock into the LATCH loops for the older child. Not only is a 5-point seat harness safer but it is much easier for a child to buckle themselves instead of reaching around to the side.As far as the options available for a child who has outgrown a convertible seat but is too small for a regular seat belt, this is a nice option.",United States,IL

My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, it should come with more play sheets and they are NOT waterproof.  Other than that, a fun toy.  After I got this, I did find it at Target for the same price it's listed here with no s&h charges but still don't regret getting it. ",United States,PA

I found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat.  I was delighted when I found the Urban Me Bundle.  I don't have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out.  We just put on her hat and go.  The Urban Me Bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort.  It helps too that it is rain resistant.  I have received many compliments on my Urban Me Bundle and found it to be a wise investment. It really doesn't compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out,United States,VA

B000BNKIMQ,Wheelie Car Seat Carrier &#150; Black by JL Childress: Baby,baby,3 of 3,5.0,Handy Car Seat Carrier,"February 20, 2007",Marieke Bermon,"NY, USA","Before realising that there actually was such a thing as a car seat carrier, my husband and I used to stuff our car seat into plastic garbage bags and tape them shut. It kept the seat clean (and we even had plenty of airline staff commend us on even thinking to bag our seat to keep it clean), but obviously did nothing to make it easier to tote around the airport.Then I found out about car seat carriers, and chose this one as it had the most favourable reviews. It was purchased just before a trip to Colorado, and has since also been to Europe and back. I'm extremely happy with this item. It's relatively easy to put our convertible Evenflo car seat into, and the canvas and zippers have held up well, with no obvious signs of wear yet, even after braving the luggage belts.The only tip I can give people is that my husband and I found that the car seat has a tendency to wobble or tip over more when pulled in a more upright position (much like small wheelie carry on luggage), and was more stable to pull when you had it leaning backward quite far, so that it's center of gravity is lower. So you might need/be able to use the strap that comes with it or something else to attach to the handle so that you have some extra length to tip it back further. Both my husband and I were a little too tall for just the handle to do that comfortably. For anyone looking for a way to more easily take their carseat along, I definitely recommend this product",United States,NY
B000C22J2S,Visionaire Peter Potty Toddler Urinal: Baby,baby,1 of 1,4.0,Good for the price,"April 7, 2007","SoundMom ""Rachel""",CT,"I bought this for my reluctant potty-trainer, and he's used it once and tried to go in it several times, but the real blessing has been his 6-year-old brother using it. I have one bathroom, and one very messy boy who never lifts the toilet seat. This has saved me from having to clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises. I do have to check the collection reservoir a lot, though, because my older son does ""go"" a lot, as big boys will. The flushing mechanism works well and is a necessary part - it saves a lot of time you may spend scrubbing and rinsing a traditional training potty. Plus, the pee collects in a part of the potty the child doesn't have easy access to, unlike a trainer potty that they can pee in, then stand up and step in or put on their head when your back is turned for a second (I speak from experience). Makes it much more sanitary.The only problems I've encountered are my kids flushing it constantly (mostly when it was new), simultaneously filling the collection reservoir and draining the water and therefore creating two jobs for me to repeat every five minutes, the fact that my three-year-old still can't quite get it that he can't sit on it and do #2, and the fact that it's just a little off-balance, so unless you wall-mount it or lean it up against a wall, you could have an icky mess.

The suction isnt too fast, which is great.  My baby doesnt get choked.  She latches easily to the nipple since it is the same as the pacifier that she loves.  My only gripe is that since the bottles are so wide they cover the whole lower part of her face and it smooshes her nose.  There isnt a curve in the bottle, so when the milk gets low you either have to lean the baby back more, which I dont like, or either mash the bottle on her nose.  Its avoidable, but I tend to do it whithout realizing sometimes.  Id rather just stick with a bottle like playtex with a curver or a bottle that is slimer.  I still use the bottles, but I just have to make sure the whole time I'm feeding that it isnt mashing her nose so she can breath",United States,

I was strolling the baby aisle in Target when I saw these and was thrilled.  In the store the 3 pack of 5 oz bottles was half of what they are here on amazon.  I love the width of the bottles because it's super easy to add in formula and make sure everything is really clean.  The lid also snaps onto the bottom which helps keep them from mysteriously disappearing.Our baby is now 8 weeks old and these are still doing well.  This bottle has really cut down on the amount of mess our baby makes when eating also.  Double check to make sure the top is on tight and you shouldn't have any leaking problems.

Dane,"Richardson, TX USA","I am one of those people who used to think horrible things about people who put their kids on leashes.  Then I became mom to a very busy and independent little girl who started walking at 9 months.  I bought the Harness Buddy for a cruise we were taking when my daughter was 16 months.  I couldn't imagine trying to keep up with her on the ship and she will not sit in a stroller for an extended period of time.  The first time we used it I started having images of her reacting like what happens when you put a cat on a leash, but she loved it.  She enjoys her freedom even if it is limited by the leash.  I cannot tell you how many people have commented on how cute it is!  It is so soft and cuddly.  We now use it in the mall and have seen more and more people with the same Harness Buddy.  Oh, and I think the fact that she is getting exercise instead of sitting in the stroller is fantastic.  We love it!",United States,TX

We do need to put in a specialized cushon for our baby's head. There have been recent articles warning against letting your baby sleep in a child seat and sine babies' head muscles aren't very strong, the support is a good addition.  I find the triangle grip excellent but even with a small baby in the seat, you will not want to cary this very far at all.  My wife in fact had a back injury carying our son in this seat and that was just from the car to our house !  Some day, these seats may come with some other innovation making them more ergonomic for parents.  I don't know that it would have been different in another seat, but be warned, these things are not meant to actually carry a child by hand and women have weakened muscles after giving birth. It's a terrible combination.  Carying the baby in this seat should be a task for husbands for several months as I found out too late.Back to the seat, it works quite well in the car and with the baby trend snap-n-go. We use the snap-n-go quite often and it prevents you from repeatedly removing your child from the seat and snapping him back in (which can be trying for you and your kid).I was disappointed the unit had no SPF rating for the sun shade. That feature may not have made it to child seats but sun protection is extremely important for babies and it wouldn't be difficult to use a protective fabric.  I called Baby Trend and they had no idea if and how well the shade actually blocked harmful UV rays.  Other seats may not have this feature either but we will look closely for it in the future after being sternly warned by the child safety class at the hospital.  Babies have super sensitive skin and it's important to avoid any direct sunlight if possible. I know it sounds extreme and alarmist but it also should be very easy to do and is recommended by the American Adadamy of Pediatrics ([...]). For now, you would need an additional cover on top of the included cover.Pros: Consumer report top pick, not as expensive as someCons: No SPF rating or sun UV protection listed for sun shade.

It has held up really well.  My only advice: with a retail price of $232.00 and even an Amazon price of $152, it's still too steep.  I never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby - and he was constantly napping, so I hardly ever ""made"" the bed.  Next time around, I'm going to find a pattern I like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it, then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet. The room itself is what you and everyone else sees.  The bedding is almost impossible to see, unless you're hovering over the crib.

However, the helpful hint I have to give comes from my other half who already has a son and has used a wipe warmer. He said the wipe warmers that heat from the bottom up (heat ALL of the wipes) are a waste of money because by the time you get to the bottom wipes....they are dried out from being continuously reheated. They basically lose their moisture which defeats the purpose of a wipe in the first place and you end up throwing a bunch of them out without the benefit of using them first. We opted to go with this one because it seems to be smaller (more convenient for travel which we will do a fair amount of) and it heats just the first few wipes which is usually all you need for a diaper change. Some mothers would say this is not really a necessary thing to have (after all, babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things were invented), but because our baby will be born during the winter, I thought this would have more use for us. I gave this product four stars because we haven't tried it yet....but just wanted to pass that helpful hint along to other mothers who are interested in practicality and saving money and hopefully not losing quality in the process",United States,MO

Finally, at 6am, my wife says, ""Hey, lets try the secure sleeper that we bought"". We haven't removed it from her bassinet since. The product does as it says and we swear by it. She is only 2 1/2 weeks old now and sleeps about 5-6 hrs a night. The velcro ""rolls"" can adjust to the babies size. The previous statement about baby falling off may be because the baby is too large. Given the size of the secure sleeper, it's not hard to believe that it will not last once the baby is larger than the sleeper. Overall, a great product!",United States,FL
B0000D9SR8,Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat: Baby,baby,1 of 1,5.0,Love this!,"January 4, 2007","Maria C. Drees ""bigPIMA""","Las Vegas, NV","Despite some negative reviews I got this seat because I have an 8 mth and 2.5 yr old and my husband is deployed so bathtime can be very challenging. I also have a textured bathtub bottom so I knew a bathring would not work. Well this seat is fantastic - my baby loves to sit in it and tries to grab all of the bath toys so he can chew on them. Also, whenever I get the baby in the toddler wants to jump in too which is so much easier then conjoling an ornery 2 yr old into the tub. Since using the bath seat my infant hasn't scraped his legs on it once like some other reviewers mentioned so not sure what that is about. And although he has tried to climb out a couple of times he is usually content to sit there. Of course even with this seat you can't let such little ones bathe unsupervised anyways so it is fine when he tries to get out - I just put him back and he is happy. Even when I don't bath the two together I put the little one in here - just makes it so much easier then trying to hold him steady (he is such a wiggler - trying to crawl/stand immediately)and having my hands free to scrub him. To clean his bottom I just pull him out clean him and then stick him back in - no problem. To clean the seat I've followed the advice of other posts and again no problem.I actually came back here to buy one for my sister but I see that it isn't available right now -boo - I'll have to find it elsewhere.

We were skeptical, because we wanted a nursery that was affordable, yet not too flimsy.  We were pleasantly surprised once the pieces were put together. The pieces coordinate beautifully with the nursery, and will take our soon-to-be-born infant into childhood. And the nicest part is that you don't have to spend thousands of dollars to have a nice nursery. My friends and family are constantly complimenting us on how great the pieces look and how sturdy they are. * The only reason I rated this 4-stars instead of 5 was because two of the drawers rubbed together slightly once assembled. It was very easily fixed by adjusting the drawer tracks, took 5 minutes. BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a beautiful, quality nursery that is affordable, this is a great choice",tai wan,

However, beware that the motor is very loud -- I definitely wouldn't recommend taking this one to work or anywhere else that you would need to be discreet.

I am extremely pleased with this pump.  I can easily fill two bottles within a few minutes and have never had any trouble with the suction, motor, malfunctioning equipment, etc.  It is extremely easy to put together and take apart, as well as easy to clean.  You will have to buy a pack of Medela bottles before the first use as they are not included.  And yes, the motor is a little noisy, but not unbearably so.  It has neither disrupted my children's sleep, for example, nor become irritating for me.  It is also versatile enough to pump on both sides simultaneously or just on one side.  Additionally, the Medela company has a very solid reputation and I understand that their customer service is very good when it comes to problems with their products.  I think that this pump is a wise choice for part-time use (not more than once or twice a day, at that).  I've had much success and I think that most of you will too",United States,MD

The thing I don't like, but certainly can live with, is the motor not being attached to the breast shield.  My chest is rather large, so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option.  I have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap.  I can't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because I don't have a free hand.

B000CR1UDM,Zooper Twist Red Lightweight Umbrella Stroller - Everyday Line: Baby,baby,3 of 3,5.0,Better than the rest!!,"April 25, 2007","Kelly J. Silva ""seattlefamily""","Seattle, WA","This is a wonderful stroller.  I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered it, sight unseen.I ordered the red version, which is much snazzier in person than on the Amazon picture.It is fairly lightweight - much lighter than our Graco model, but heavier than those cheap little umbrella strollers, nice and sturdy.  But it folds up in an umbrella fashion, so it won't take up too much room in your trunk and could be carried, if necessary.It comes with neat things like a rain cover, sun shade, and cold weather boot.  The rain and shade covers are neatly contained in an attachable pouch and the boot fits easily in the stroller's basket.The canopy has a window, provides lots of shade, and is even partially removable to let the breeze run through on a balmy day.  Coolest of all, it has a built in mesh pouch that doesn't take up any room but still manages to hold everything I need: sunscreen, hand sanitizer, wallet, keys, cell phone, and sunglasses.  It's stretchy mesh, so if you don't have anything it just lies flat against the hood.  But it does have a plastic lining, so it's waterproof!  Also, it zips, so your things can't fall out and aren't accessible to your two year old, either.The basket is large enough for a medium sized diaper bag, although a small bag would fit best, especially if you want to keep the boot in there.The best part is that everything is snazzy.  Everything looks nice, the materials feel great, and it's well designed.  The parts that should be removable/washable are.It's a snap to put together (took just a couple of minutes) and everything locks into place in a smart way.  It's very easy to fold and unfold.  Also, it reclines beautifully and easily, including into a totally upright position.  I became frustrated that my Graco model's most upright position was still too reclined for our one year old.    The place where your child's legs hang down is neat.  It is adjustable, so it could stick straight out, hang down, or even flip up for a very little one (maybe to use with the boot?)...  Your kid won't get a weird stroller mark on the underside of their little knees.It has the newer style which I notice most new strollers seem to have where you only have to clip two things in to buckle a baby in.  My Graco model (purchased last year) is such a complicated mess.  You attach two things together on one side, two things together on the other side, then connect each side into the center.  Arg!  My son almost always fussed by the time I'd finished.  Also, he was always sitting on one of the straps, which easily became twisted.  My husband STILL has not figured out how to do this quickly.  :)  So this is a big improvement.It's also comfy!  I can't vouch for that myself, of course.  But my son settles down into it and looks perfectly comfortable.  With the Graco model, he ended up with his legs flung over one side of the tray and if he wasn't tightly belted in he slouched down a lot.A few minor imperfections about the Zooper Twist.  The cupholder is a mesh bag attached to the handle.  It works well for a standard water bottle or something, but one of those giant mall-sized beverages might not be so great.  You can easily remedy this by investing in a good quality cup attachment, if that is important to you.This stroller is great for me - I'm 5'5.  It would be nice if the stroller handles were adjustable.This isn't a jogging stroller.  It does offer a nice feature where you can lock the front two wheels so they do not swivel, which makes going over rough surfaces safer and easier to manage.This isn't the kind of stroller that is going to hold everything but the kitchen sink, if you are looking for that kind of stroller.  There isn't a cup and snack tray for your child.  No clock.This is just the greatest stroller and I'm so glad to dump our awful Graco stroller.  Hated. that. thing.  This is snazzy, well designed, handy, lightweight, convenient, and offers everything we need",United States,WA

It was a perfect fit on its own.Pros: 1. it is the best car seat you can get!2. has side impact protection -- also makes a good headrest when baby falls asleep3. the adjust knob for the harness is awesome to adjust especially over large coats4. the seat is very well cushioned, soft fabric5. fits fine a small car even rear facing (I have a Civic)6. it's heavy so its not going anywhere!7. works for up to 65 pounds, so we will get a lot of use out of the seat8. she loves it!Cons:1. it is large/heavy (though it is staying in my car so heavy is not a problem)2. the strap to tighted the harness is a little tough to pull tight on a smaller child, but you need to pull straight out and not up3. it is expensiveI highly recommend this seat (we have the Onyx fabric). It is large, heavy and expensive, but it is the best!! I had buyer's remorse for a few minutes, but I figured it is the best seat on the market right now and $300 is a small price to pay for protecting my daughter. I did a lot of research before buying and felt confident in my decision and in the seat! Very pleased with this seat! Also, please make sure you get your seat installed by a certified technician (Check with your local Children's Hospital). Improperly installed car seats and improper use of car seats is the leading cause of death among children and infants. Something very easy to prevent",United States,AL
B000A1AF8Q,Britax Boulevard Brownstone: Baby,baby,11 of 11,5.0,I love this car seat!!,"June 16, 2006",Liza M. Brady,"University Heights, OH","Our 8-month-old daughter outgrew her infant carrier, and we needed a ""big girl"" car seat immediately.  I knew that we were going to purchase a car seat made by Britax because they are always consistently highly rated in crash tests and by other safety measures.  After reading reviews and checking out the Roundabout, Marathon and Boulevard seats in the store, we decided on the Boulevard.  I love the added protection the side-impact wings provide.  True, it is just about the most expensive car seat out there, but I believe it is well worth the price.The only drawback was that I found none of the fabric options particuarly appealing.  I finally settled on Brownstone because I believe it to be the least dreadful of them all.  I was surprised to find that it is not as bad as I had imagined.  It is extremely soft (almost has a chenille-like feel) and does not get too hot (even in direct sunlight).  There is also the option of ordering different covers, if I tire of this one.This car seat is pretty big, but it fits just fine in our Honda Accord (in the  middle of the back seat), and two normal-size people can easily fit on either side.  It was very easy to install using the LATCH system.  I have not had any problems or complaints.My daughter seems very comfortable in her new car seat, and I feel safe with her in it",United States,OH

There is also a front flap with a magnetic closure with one zippered pocket on the outside and a wallet organizer on the inside...the perfect area for mom's stuff.  There is a cell phone compartment on the front of the bag and a bottle pocket on each side of the bag.  The construction and material are very sturdy and everything closes up nicely so there is no risk of spilliage.

The pressure gates we already had were difficult for our 3 and 5 year olds to get pass and it gets difficult constantly lifting them over the gate.  This gate is well worth the money.  The remote unit is on the wall in a place where everyone can reach it, except for the 13 month old of course.  It is so much easier for everyone.  With all of the use our gate gets, the spot welds broke one day.  You really miss this gate when you have to go back to using a pressure gate again.  I called customer support, concerned because I do longer had my receipt or even the box.  The spot welds breaking loose was a problem they hadn't had reported before (so this apparently isn't a common problem!)  I was told we would receive a new gate within two weeks and the old one would be inspected by engineers to determine what had occured.  I was very impressed!

My Baby's face just lights up when he's placed in his bed for naps or night time. However we find ourself running back in forth so much because the cute little songs have stopped before he falls asleep.  I was looking online and saw that some of these new mobiles have remotes on them. It would seem that with the all the new things that come out the manufactors would have given the public the option to have a wind up mobile or a remote mobile.  I hope that someone from these places reads these and takes the time to put more thought into what parents would want in future purchases.

Although, if you read the instructions for ANY mobile, when the child is old enough to sit or stand in the crib (around 6 months), you are supposed to take it off.  They are not built for anyone to play with them.  My son liked his mobile so much that when he was old enough to reach it, we took it off and my husband attached it to the top of his hutch.  This way we were still able to play the song, but he couldn't reach it.  I think this mobile is a perfect way to add to the room's theme.  For those who looking to buy this mobile, or any other mobile:  Go to the store where you are buying your crib, and try it out.  The people at Babies R Us must have thought I was nuts, because I took the quilt and the mobile from the set I wanted and took them to the crib I was buying.  I was able to determine if the mobile would fit before I bought it, and I got to see how the colors in the bedding looked with the color of the crib.  This eliminated a lot of hassle for me later on with taking the mobile back if it didn't fit",United States,PA

He immediately loved the musical buttons and the sun, and ignored everything else. As he grew, he discovered the other toys one by one. It was exciting to watch him perfecting the different skills necessary to manipulate the activities.Because I used the Baby Einstein as a secure place for meals, it needed regular cleaning. The seat pops right off for easy cleaning, but the cloth saddle is a little hard to unsnap from the base. Overall, the assembly is pretty easy - I put it together myself and I am NOT mechanically inclined.I definitely recommend the Baby Einstein activity center. I looked at several other brands and was turned off by all the obnoxious toys and activities. I wanted something Toby could learn from, not just be dazzled by the bells and whistles.

That might not be an important issue for older babies but my daughter was 4 months old when she started to use this and compared to the other exersaucer,it really makes a differnce having a seat she can maneuver.

It's like a little sleeping bag. Unfortunately, I think my son will be too big for his current carrier when winter befalls us again.

I feel sorry for all the people who bought my daughter thick sweaters, and the aunt who bought her a snow suit.  We just never use them.  I can zip her into the Bundle Me and head out for a walk in the stroller.  She usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy.  When she was smaller, we used it in the infant car seat which fit into our stroller.  It meant she was zipped in before we opened the door and unzipped when we reached our destination.  She never felt the cold!It is really easy to use and fits on our two different strollers and car seats. ",Canada,BC

Altman ""gocheapbooks""",suburbs of new york city,"ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional? Well, pretty much everyone i know, and they are all right of course.  Each baby is exceptional, in their own way.  But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians, nurses and early childhood educators?  Well, I know one - MINE!  I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant.  One time when using it, he started knocking back. Yeap, i actually felt him knock back at it, in rhythm.  It only happened once, but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid.  I was about 7 months pregnant then.  Well, lo and behold, after he was born people (professionals) don't stop telling us how amazing he is.  He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet.  He is 2 months old now, and has been sleeping through the night (11 hours at a time) since he was 2 weeks.  He cries when he needs something, and never cries for no reason (but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don't know how much that has to do with it.).  Yesterday he started reaching for objects.  Can't quite grab them yet, but it doesn't stop him from trying. The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is, how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age.  He's been holding his head up since the day he was born (3 days late) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks.  So, i don't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it.  I mean it could be just an accident but... all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children.  I would pay thousands if i had to (and we are not rich people) because its worth every penny",South Africa,Gauteng

Overall, the assembly is pretty easy - I put it together myself and I am NOT mechanically inclined.I definitely recommend the Baby Einstein activity center.

My Baby's face just lights up when he's placed in his bed for naps or night time. However we find ourself running back in forth so much because the cute little songs have stopped before he falls asleep.  I was looking online and saw that some of these new mobiles have remotes on them. It would seem that with the all the new things that come out the manufactors would have given the public the option to have a wind up mobile or a remote mobile.  I hope that someone from these places reads these and takes the time to put more thought into what parents would want in future purchases. But like as I said before we love the look and love they way my son reacts to it.  So I'll look at this mobile being a weight loss bonus for all the running back and forth,United States,TX
B00007LB1E,Koala Baby Musical Mobile - Locomotion: Baby,baby,1 of 1,5.0,Re:  Dangerous from CSM,"February 6, 2005",Mom of 3,"Pittsburgh, PA","I completely understand your concern.  Although, if you read the instructions for ANY mobile, when the child is old enough to sit or stand in the crib (around 6 months), you are supposed to take it off.  They are not built for anyone to play with them.  My son liked his mobile so much that when he was old enough to reach it, we took it off and my husband attached it to the top of his hutch.  This way we were still able to play the song, but he couldn't reach it.  I think this mobile is a perfect way to add to the room's theme.  For those who looking to buy this mobile, or any other mobile:  Go to the store where you are buying your crib, and try it out.  The people at Babies R Us must have thought I was nuts, because I took the quilt and the mobile from the set I wanted and took them to the crib I was buying.  I was able to determine if the mobile would fit before I bought it, and I got to see how the colors in the bedding looked with the color of the crib.  This eliminated a lot of hassle for me later on with taking the mobile back if it didn't fit",United States,PA

It was such a pain to get him into winter outerwear, and even more a pain to take it off when we got to where we were going. When I found this Bundleme product, I knew it would be much easier to survive the winter months in Michigan with my second child. It fits easily into my Graco infant carseat/carrier. I don't have to worry about dressing him up, I just put a hat on him and off we go!! It's also easier to buckle the baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere- and probably safer too!! When we get to where ever we are going I just unzip the sides and he's fine. So far we have endured 40 degree temps, rain, wind and snow and he's stayed warm and snug as a bug the whole time!! Truly an excellent purchase!",United States,

I used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach (where it's usually windy and cooler during the fall). It's very easy to switch from/to any stroller (less than 1 minute). When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas, I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot. In San Diego one fall day, when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet, she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home. Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road, or having enough blankets to keep baby warm, or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets, lost a shoe/sock, etc.  I am now using the same bundle me with my second child. I'd recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks, etc",United States,CA

After using this product a few times I decided I was wrong. I {{LOVE}} this product. It fit perfectly in my infant carrier. Dressing my newborn son was not a process he enjoyed let alone being put into the carrier. With the Bundle Me I didn't have to struggle putting my baby in any coats or buntings then struggle with the bulkiness to get him into the carrier in order to take him out into the cold. An additional bonus I found was that if I needed to take him indoors but keep him in the carrier I didn't need to worry about him overheating. I just had to unzip the top blanket and pull it back. It's like a little sleeping bag. Unfortunately, I think my son will be too big for his current carrier when winter befalls us again. I think we will be moving on to a carseat instead of a carrier at that point so the Bundle Me will be less useful. Even if I just use the seat portion and keep the blanket top for extra cold days it will workout great. I already consider it well worth the money",United States,PA

We used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink, which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage.  Once her stump fell off, and she was able to control her head well, we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby's bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub.  A perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath.  This is the position in which we currently use our tub.  Now, however, we bathe her in the Aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we don't have to worry about where the water lands.

The only downside is that the swing motor does make noise, but the sound is relatively minimal and can be easily tuned out.

Ward ""High Priest of NuclearPhynance""","Breux-Jouy, Ile de France France","This is an excellent lightweight stroller and is the one we use most often. We have a more expensive, larger, ""safer"" stroller with more features, but we have found we never use it and always use this one.Collapsing the stroller to pop into the car is a breeze, and there is an adequate shoulder strap for you to carry the stroller when you are doing portage over rough ground.We take the stroller everywhere. We've used it on well-groomed trails for hiking, museums, restaurants, we've even used it at the beach, and we've used it on the Paris Metro. This is a great stroller for train and subway travel.The wheels have a lock feature which allows them to rotate, or swivel, and the rear wheels have a brake mechanism which is a little awkward to release, but I find that comforting rather than frustrating: I want solid brakes.There is a small basket in the back of the stroller for a baby bag, purse, and a few groceries, so this again is an excellent stroller for when you are just running out for a few things or going on a small picnic. If I was an apartment dweller in the city, this is the stroller I'd get.The only bad feature: this is not a stroller you can run with! Don't even try.The harness is excellent, but takes time to adjust it correctly so that it is not too snug nor too loose. This is a super lightweight stroller, but is a quality product with excellent engineering and design. It is not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways and just has the MacLaren name on it: this is the real deal. We have used it for two kids, still works like new.

B00003XAQZ,Basic Comfort Handy'S Plus Pad - Full: Baby,baby,7 of 7,5.0,A perfect potty training system (when you buy two),"October 18, 2006","LAK ""lakdek""","Newtown, PA United States","While my 4 yr old had been potty trained since she was about 2-1/2, she wasn't making it thru the night & so we used Pull Up every night. Shortly after she turned 4 she started waking up with dry pull ups.  We gave it a few weeks to make sure it wasn't a fluke & then invested in *two* of these pads.  The tuck in feature on both sides is great & I find that it does stay in place even after a nights sleep.  She finds it comfortable as she's never complained about it (of course, Princess sheets accomanied this new pad to encourage acceptance and we made a HUGE deal about her giving up Pull Ups & sleeping in regular underwear).  The best part about this design is that if there is an accident, you just whip it off (and any other top sheet that might have gotten wet) and tuck in a dry one.  No changing the fitted sheet in the middle of the night.  For us, if the top sheet or blanket gets wet, I've got a second comforter/blanket in her closet to quickly throw over her. (of course pajama changing can't be avoided) That helps get everyone back to sleep as fast as possible.  I've washed them a number of times & they come out of the dryer in the same shape every time (follow washing instructions). The size is also generous.  I was worried that she might move off the pad during the night, but with proper placement to where she normally sleeps most of the night, we've never had a problem.  It says it absorbs 6 cups; while we haven't tested that, I've never found the pad dripping, so all the urine was securely soaked in.  We haven't found a down side to these pads.  Even the price isn't bad-- I did some price comparison and maybe you'll find them a few bucks less, but not by much.  And, if I may add in a bit of my own potty training 2-cents, my husband wanted her to give up pull ups much earlier, but I was in no mood to change sheets (or these pads) *every* night.  I've read that most toddlers' bladders aren't large enough to make it thru the night anyway, so I was just as happy to let it happen naturally. In that way, everyone was happy (well I was and you know what they say about Mamma being happy-- everyone's happy!)  Thus, I highly recommend this pad to anyone going down the no-more-Pull-Ups Road.  I am sure it would be just as useful for any older child (and parents) dealing with bed-wetting problem. ",United States,PA

We have used it with all the grandchildren (6) and one nephew.    I think it needs some design improvements:    (1) the straps which are used to hold it to a chair would be better if there were a strap which went from front to back, not just around the back of the seat. One of the grandkids seems unable to sit still and I keep expecting him to tip over the chair because it tends to slide sideways in the front.    (2) the tray is designed for a slim child. On one side, the tray fits a finger like protusion into a hole. On the other side, there are 2 places to attach the tray in slots. Only when the tray is in the innermost position, is it aligned directly in front of the child and there isn't a great deal of tummy room. If you move the tray to the outer position (available on one side only), the tray is cocked at an angle and it still probably wouldn't accomodate a child with a larger stomach.    (3) the belts to hold the child need to be longer.    Fortunately for us, all the grandkids and nephew are slim. At least so far",United States,OR

I think that people need to take into consideration the height and weight proportion when buying the product. Every child is different, with different weight and height which means different shapes.

It needs to be screwed into the wall on both sides.  However, I have learned the hard way that the pressure-mounted gates do a lot of damage to walls, they are more difficult to operate, and they are bulky. If the need for a gate is going to be relatively long-term, I now believe that it is easier to screw it in and worry about patching the wall when the time comes.I've also learned that gates with vertical bars are more likely to be left alone because it's more difficult for pups to get a purchase on them.

When have given a four - except - at 2 months my baby started to HATE having wetness next to her skin - at all - and it would wake her from her naps( could use a fleece liner and solve that problem) and they take FOREVER to dry - I'll hang them on the line all day and then still have to dry them for 20 mins.- Overall they are GREAT,United States,GA

The comb and brush are perfect, and she absolutely LOVES the rattle! Surprise! I thought it was just kind of an extra, but we take it with us everywhere. The suction bulb isn't that bad like others have said. The case that it comes in is really great! It has a pocket for storing other things in the back which we use for nose drops, tylenol, etc. Having it all in one place is great because we can easily grab it and go if we are going to grandma's.

Soon enough they outgrew the seating layout and the mirror got stowed in the door pocket.  It was great for the kids and us and we really got a lot of use out of it.  But wait, we weren't done with it yet!When I got my Jeep, I happened to come across the little mirror again and decided to try it for a blind spot mirror.  I never liked those little circular ones that go on the side mirrors because they take up too much room and they're so small they aren't really very useful.  Instead I stuck this mirror up on the left corner of my windshield where the only thing it blocked is low flying aircraft.  And it provides a rear-view that covers my blind spot perfectly and is large enough to actually see what's going on.  The added bonus is that because it's inside, it never gets wet, icy or fogged up.  It's been on my windshield ever since.The kids are 7 and 9 now so that little mirror is almost a decade old and it still sticks to the window and has survived several bumps and never broke!

Hatch ""EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL""","PORT RICHEY, FL","I DECIDED TO POTTY TRAIN MY SON USING JUST A POTTY TOPPER AND A STOOL. HE REALLY LOVES TO DO THINGS ALL BY HIMSELF JUST LIKE MOMMY AND DADDY SO I FIGURED THAT WOULD WORK BEST FOR HIM. NO MATTER WHAT I DID HE CONTINUED TO HAVE ACCIDENT AFTER ACCIDENT. WE WOULD SIT IN THE BATHROOM FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND HE WOULD ALWAYS PEE AFTER I TOOK HIM OFF THE POTTY. I DECIDED THAT GETTING HIM HIS OWN POTTY SEAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO SIT ON THE POTTY FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME, INFRONT OF THE TV OR IN THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE FAMILY, OR IN HIS ROOM. I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE JUST THE THING TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND SO I WENT ON THE INTERNET TO PICK ONE OUT. I PICKED THE BABYBJORN POTTY CHAIR BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THE DESIGN, EASY CLEAN UP AND THE DEFLECTOR. MOST SEATS HAVE VERY SMALL DEFLECTORS OR NONE AT ALL. SOME HAVE DEFLECTORS THAT DON'T STAY PUT. I ALSO LIKED THAT IS WAS DESIGNED TO STAY ON THE FLOOR AND NOT SLIP, SLIDE, OR GET STUCK TO THE CHILD.THE DAY THIS ARRIVED MY SON HAD HAD THREE CONSECUTIVE ACCIDENTS TO SPITE THAT FACT THAT WE HAD SPEND MOST OF THE DAY IN THE BATHROOM. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND PUT HIM BACK IN PULL UPS WHEN IT FINALLY ARRIVED. HE WAS SCARED AT FIRST BUT I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS HIS VERY OWN NEW POTTY CHAIR AND THE SECOND HE SAT DOWN HE PEED IN IT!!! I LET HIM TAKE THE POT TO THE BIG POTTY AND DUMP IT WITH ME AND THAT WAS IT! HE WAS HOOKED. I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO ENCOURAGE HIM ANYMORE OR HARASS HIM TO SIT DOWN. HE WOULD JUST RUN RIGHT OVER AND PEE AND THEN DECLARE ""I DID IT!!!! MOMMY HELP ME DUMP IT."" HE ONLY USED THIS POTTY CHAIR FOR ONLY ONE DAY BUT IT WAS DEFINETLY WHAT HE NEEDED TO GET THE IDEA. THE VERY NEXT MORNING HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO USE THE BIG POTTY NOW AND HAS NEVER LOOKED BACK. WE USE THE POTTY CHAIR NOW FOR OUTINGS. IT IS GREAT! EASY TO CLEAN AND EASY TO BRING ALONG IN THE CAR!!! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 5 STARS IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT THE DEFLECTOR IS JUST A BIT LOW. IF MY SON WASN'T LEANING FORWARD TO WATCH HIMSELF PEE IT WOULD BE A CLOSE CALL.THERE WERE A FEW REVIEWS THAT STATED THAT THEIR CHILD'S LEGS WERE BEING SQUISHED BECAUSE OF THE DEFLECTOR BEING SO WIDE...MY SON WILL BE 3 IN 2 MONTHS AND HE IS A BIG BOY IN THE TOP 75 PERCENT FOR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT AND HE FIT FINE WITH LOTS OF ROOM TO SPARE!!!

Cannon,"Concord, NH USA",My husband and I bought this gate to keep our precocious and exceptionally curious toddler out of the kitchen. (It took her about a week to figure out how to open all the safety locks on the cabinets.) When the gate arrived the box was heavily damaged and the gate was broken. We called customer service at Summer and they had a new gate and free return shipping label to us in three days! Installation was fairly easy for my husband who is not particularly handy with tools. We like the fabric/mesh since our daughter can't climb it like other gates. The only thing I don't like quite so much is that the latching mechanism is not terribly easy to use. You have to line up the gate and then pull slightly on the handle to seat the latch properly. Takes a little while to get used to. All-in-all we would definitely recommend this gate to others who have large openings to close off,United States,NH

These gates allow me to stop my baby from going up a staircase, down a staircase or out a door using all three panels which expand up to twelve feet. If you don't need all that length you can detach a panel or use it in a v-shape to angle it while using all three panels.I found it so easy to install just using two brackets on each wall. The screws and anchors provided were all I needed to install into drywall. Plus they give you a template to make it even easier to line up the screws. The gate swings open in either direction and is easy to open for an adult but I don't think my baby will figure it out for years to come.

B000JOOGK2,Magnet Locks by Kidco (4 locks per package - key sold separately): Baby,baby,2 of 2,5.0,GREAT PRODUCT! DON'T BE TURNED OFF BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS REVIEWER!!,"February 12, 2007",mamazo,"Jersey City, NJ USA","What the previous reviewer didn't realize is that there are 2 different packaging options for this item. The first option is a pack that contains 1 key and 2 locks for people who want to try it out and the second option is to buy the pack that contains 4 locks but no key for those who already bought the starter kit and happened to like the product. So make sure you really read the description of what you're getting if you're buying online. (This one happens do be the 4 locks with no key so you might want to try the starter kit first...I actually rec. it because UNFORTUNATELY the lock doesn't work with all situations because of draw designs) Then on top of that Kidco also sells the key seperately with no locks for those who have the product, love it, and happened to misplace or lose their key OR want to purchase an additional incase they ever lose the 1st key. I will admit that I think it's pretty lame for a company to try to squeeze every penny out of you especially when it probaby only costs 5 cents to make the darn key and especially when you're dealing with child safety products. As far as how well the product works...I LOVE IT and wish it had worked out better with all my draw situations! It's especially great for those cabinet doors that stand alone and don't have another door next to it where you can just buy one of those wrap around door knob locks that require 2 knobs to be side by side. I didn't have as great of luck with my kitchen draws because the draw panel is added on to the actual draw so it isn't flush with where you put the catch. I put 5 stars to bring the rating up because the last reviewer only gave one and it's actually a great product. I know it will outsmart my baby far beyond any cheaper options out there. I installed them with the adhesive tape that comes with it but I plan on reattaching it with the screws also included because I personally feel that the screws will do a better job AND because I love my child more than my freaking cabinet doors for all those worried about messing up your precious wood cabinets...I mean give me a break...the holes are so small anyway and it's totally concealed, only you will know it's there. ALSO, this locks so tight that little fingers/hands can't reach inside small openings (which usually occures with the other types of locks) and pull stuff out. And also there's an option to turn the lock off for in between kids. DEFINITELY CONSIDER THIS PRODUCT!!!!",United States,NJ

Not wanted to return a product I was sure would come in handy I moved it to my 20 month old's car seat and it worked and fit great.

I am not overly concerned about germs and my son never really chewed much on shopping cart handles - HOWEVER - he is a really SQUIRMY.  We've had a terrible time getting him to sit forward and stay seated in a shopping cart.  Which makes grocery shopping precarious.  He is very quick to stand up and turn around in the cart if we take our eyes off him.  I looked and looked for a five-point harness that I could use with a shopping cart and then stumbled across the Shop n' Dine at TJMaxx.  IT WORKS WONDERS.  He was so secure and comfortable.  We never once had to sit him back down, turn him around, or anything.  I also had a place for my own drink that was out of his reach (the cup holder on front held my fast-food super-size drink).  My son never complained about the seat and I wish I had found this months earlier (he is 14 months now).  It's perfect.  One thing I found was that I was able to use the shopping cart strap in addition to the 5-point harness on this product which in effect made a 7-point harness (over the shoulders and between the legs with the product and around the chest with the shopping cart strap).  Another thing - My son usually pulls shoulder straps off, but these stayed in place and he never messed with them. And even though he was straped in securely, he was comfortable and able to play with us, point to things, play with toys, etc.  He wasn't at all paralyzed or completely immobilized by the straps.

Easy to use and clean!,"September 18, 2006",San Jose Mom,"San Jose, CA United States","I got this pump because I wasn't sure if I would need an electric as a stay-at-home mom. This pump is easy to use and clean. The ergonomic pump handle is pretty easy on the hands and wrist (I could pump even when I had tendonitis which hurt when I moved my thumb). It does not take up much room when disassembled so it'll be great for travelling. I'm not that thrilled about the soft comfort flange that is provided. I prefer the regular plastic Medela flanges that come with their electric pumps. I find that I can get as much milk out of this manual pump as I can with the Medela Pump In Style electric in about the same time and this one makes a lot less noise (great for middle of the night pumping sessions to ease engorgement without waking my baby and husband up).Also, just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the Medelas... It may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges. Every woman's breast and nipples are different sizes. Initially, I was using the standard 24mm flanges (suction cup things that go over your breasts). It was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though I was engorged with plenty of milk. It would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk! I went to see a lactation consultant who suggested I try the next size up flanges (27mm). She got me one to try and it made a world of difference. I could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins. Now, I pump daily with my electric to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins (estimate since I don't really time it cause it's so fast). I use either my electric of my manual depending on my mood, whether I need to double pump, if I need my hands free (then I use the electric) or if I'm going to pump somewhere besides my bedroom (i.e. living room while watching tv with my husband).I am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank. This pump made a world of difference.  I think Medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes. The standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps, the 27mm and a 30mm.",United States,CA

It weighs about the same as the Graco and stores similarly to the Graco.  My son loved the Graco, but I found it hard to handle and I couldn't run with it.

I have a 2005 Honda CRV.  In the rear facing position the seat belt was not long enough to strap it to the seat.  My SUV only has the LATCH system on the side seats and not the middle seat.  I spoke to the car safety officier for the police department and he told me to place him in the side seat behind the passenger seat as this would be the safest place in regards to incidence of accidents since I could not use the middle position.  The reason he told me not to use the LATCH in the middle position (by using the side seats LATCH system)  since my SUV is not equipped with it is because the LATCH is connected to the car frame and if we were in an accident and the frame of the car bent it could tear his seat in pieces.  I was not aware that the LATCH was connected to the frame.  So the officier told me that when he is able to be forward facing I should be able to put him back in the middle seat as it shouldn't require so much length of the seatbelt.I love this seat and so does my son who is now 9 1/2 months.

It's super easy to attach and when not needed the shade pulls back out of the way. Depending on the angle of the sun, I can have it partially or fully extended. I've used ours for almost a year and it's held its shape. It also packs up very compactly for traveling.

On my recommendation my cousin got one and it works on her full size and her small Zooper also. I've read other reviews complaining it doesn't fit but I've tried it on many strollers of friends and it works. I think you just need to be creative in how you tie it to the stroller. I expect this shade will work on most strollers.I can see that some kids may dislike the reduced field of view when the shade is fully extended. I started using it when my daughter was only 3 months old so I think she got used to it. She's never had a problem with the reduced view.

I was stopping to fix it more than I was actually jogging.With this sunshade, she can't undo it...although she tries!  I can pull it all the way down (as low as I can on my particular jogger) and she can still see out but is shielded from the sun.  I like the side pockets - great for keys and small items - and the velcro tabs are easy to use.The only drawback - and this is such a minor issue, probably hardly worth mentioning - is that the shade doesn't fold up all nice and compact like the instructions say.  I wrestled with my shade for awhile before I finally got it folded up (it was a matter of ""doggone it, this thing isn't going to get the best of me!"")...and even then, it wasn't very stable.  My suggestion - keep the little bag it comes in and semi-fold it and store it in that.All in all, this is worth it.  Wish I'd had one when I started jogging with my daughter last year",United States,WV

I did buy it prematurely- our almost 3 year old wasn't remotely interested in using any potty, so it did sit around for a while.  But ever since she started using the potty (first hers, now ours w/ her seat), we have taken it with us everywhere.  Not just for the sanitary reasons, but every bit as much for the size.  We also use it with the pottys at her grandparents' houses or my husband's office potty which we're the only ones that use.  The couple of times (tonight included) that we've forgotten it & she had to go in public, it is a nightmare.  First there's the layers of seat covers, then and even worse is trying to position her little behind on that enormous seat with the big ol' opening in the front which means her legs have to be out at an angle so she doesn't end up right there.  Then she says it hurts from all her weight being in the two places where the seat goes across her.  Yes, I pinched myself in the beginning when we were in a hurry & I didn't have it down yet how it folded, but it was well worth it in my eyes.  Bottom line- I love it, I highly recommend it, I would be totally lost without it.  So worth three times (and more) what I paid for it",United States,CA

It's very sturdy, enough so that even my husband can use it as a seat when sitting with our daughter. All parts are very easy to clean. I started her training at 15 months, just by keeping her potty in the bathroom and having her sit on it (with her clothes on) every time my husband or I went to the bathroom. She soon got the idea and was sitting on it without a diaper. Because it took so long for her to go, we used the entire unit, but it didn't take long until we started just carrying around the padded seat for her to use on the adult potty. PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT WAS WORTH IT, EVEN IF WE'D ONLY GOTTEN THE PADDED SEAT. I bought a second seat from another manufacturer to keep in our other bathroom so we wouldn't have to go up and down stairs to fetch it every time she needed to go, but it isn't NEARLY as nice. The Primo seat isn't just a piece of plastic with a hole in the middle. It's thin and contoured to the shape of a little one's bottm. It fits snugly on the adult potty. It has rubber pads and plastic pegs on the underside to keep it from slipping when she sits down. I also like that either a boy or girl can use it, without extra parts to assemble or disassemble. There's a small rise in the front for boys, but it isn't so high that it gets in the way when the child sits down. Very sturdy, very easy to use and clean. Can't say enough about this product.",United States,AL

The instructions say 7"" between soother and mattress is necessary which means that it has to go on the head of the crib instead of the side until my baby is old enough where I reposition the height of the mattress.

The twist ties allow you to pump right into the bag which saves me from having to wash bottles everytime I pump. The other bags require you to pump into a bottle and then pour it into a bag which defeats the whole purpose. The medela bags also allow you to get all of the air out which can destroy the great quality of your milk if left inside. I store the bags upright (just in case, although I've never had a leaky bag) in a milk storage tray I bought from Babies R Us (the First Years brand). Once they are frozen, I put them in ziplock bags with the date written on them for easy retrieval when I need to defrost milk. When I am ready to defrost, I just stand them upright in a large bowl and let cold water run for about 5 minutes, and them pour into bottles. My baby never got the hang of breastfeeding, but I really wanted her to have breastmilk. She is 2 1/2 months old now, and I have been pumping milk since she was 3 days old. I eventually chose to bottlefeed exclusively, so I pump about 5 times a day. I use an entire pack of 50 bags in less than a week!!! I pump way more than she eats, so I have a lot of stored milk. Plently for when I go back to work and can't pump as often. Take it from someone who really knows. These bags are not difficult to use as everyone else will have you believe.

Secondly, I spent days, DAYS, looking for a new infant-toddler convertible seat.  I have an 05 Trailblazer and was desparately looking for a narrow seat I could fit between 2 Graco TurboBooster seats.  It's still a tight fit but it works.  This was the narrowest seat I could find on the internet.  The baby body pad definitely is a must since there is very little padding in the seat cover.  It will work for a little while, but during the summer I'm sure the baby will not stand for that much cushion around her legs, as it will make her hot.  I'll have to figure something else out at that point.  The seat looks better than I expected and is about an inch less wide than the Titan.  The Titan definitely doesn't work in between the two boosters.  I can't see any use for the pillow, other than for looks.  I'm very happy with my entire purchase",United States,VA

(NOTE: We got him the blue one, but they make you review them separately)Here's what I love: 1. Our house gets chilly at night, and even with a little space heater in his room, I worried about him being cold with no blankets! The sleep sack is snuggly and warm. 2. Our son moves constantly, awake or asleep. Any blanket you did use (even if it were safe) would never stay on him. The sleep sacks have never tangled or bunched up under him. 3. This is silly, but it just looks so darling. I love to see him all ready for bed, in his PJs and sleep sack. Our son HATED the sleepers that were sacks at the bottom, I think they felt restrictive because he would kick and kick at them and cry. He has never minded the sleep sack, maybe having his PJs on under it helps him feel more comfy. I recommend this, and recommend getting a couple in each size so that you can throw one in the wash and have another ready.",United States,PA

I have these and some Medela bottles that came with my breast pump. Dr. Browns wins -- no doubt about it! I guess I'm not as meticulous as some other reviewers on cleaning and sterilizing... I just follow the directions in the package and sterlized when I started out and then I've hand washed ever since. Now, let's face it, washing bottles is a pain regardless. Washing a few more parts is no big deal. It takes me approx. 30 seconds more to do the vent parts. And it's definitely worth the effort. The couple of times I've used the Medela bottles I could visibly see bubbles coming through the milk and rising to the top. Later my baby had lots of gas and spit up. With the Dr Browns bottles that NEVER happens. I don't even use the Medelas as backup ""emergency"" bottles anymore. I only use them to hold water if I'm taking a trip and need to bring some clean water from home to mix formula. The Dr Browns bottles are a godsend",United States,FL

Garris,"Durham, NC USA","I must agree that I tried the others - from cheap to expensive - before finally getting to the Dr.Brown bottles.  I tried others that had the same claims - even a few gimmicks that would work in theory (VentAire).  I have only found success with the Dr.Brown bottles. These bottles will sometimes leak - until you get the hang of them and keep the inner-tube empty and the collar on not-so-tight.  Usually a gentle twist of the collar will empty the inner-tube and then you can twist it back on...but not too tight.  The disks help stop leaks during travel, but you really just need to work on keeping them upright.  Yes, more cleaning - and thank goodness for microwave sterilizers.  I simply handwashed and then boiled for the first child, but love my microwave steamer now.  The markings are fading on some of my bottles, but I believe that hand-washing has saved them a little.  I compared to Avent (which were only slightly cheaper - but had lots of ""transition to sippy cup"" type of advantages (or breast pump straight to bottle).  I still love my Doc Brown's and the complaints of scratched off markings applied to the other bottles, too.  I personally preferred the wide-neck because they seem to fit my baby better, but several friends like the standard.  We all agree that the Doc Brown's are lifesavers, though.  I give a 3 pk of the 8 oz size at every baby shower",United States,NC

Emptying it was as easy as advertised, I slipped the liner through the cutter and tied off the top of the dirties and tied the bottom of the liner where we were starting over again.At first, it took two hands to un-snap the lid and get it open because it was new, now after a week it has been adequately broken in, and it truly is a one-handed operation.  Even though baby is a newborn, she's been producing some MASSIVELY stinky diapers.  Prior to receiving the Genie II, we were using a regular trashcan.  The Genie II has completely contained the smell since it has been in use, and my nursery is now blessedly odorless!The liner situation is great.  Diapers do not come in contact with the actual container which is extremely sanitary, LOVE IT!  Also, it seems that you can safely stuff a LOT of diapers into each load which is great.Bottom line, I give my highest recommendation for this product, 5 stars PLUS!!  This will be my signature shower gift to others from now on unless I get beaten to it",United States,TX

Would be nice if they included 2 inserts, but I guess just having one makes sure I clean it sooner. My daughter loves the toy that attaches to the tray. It really helps keep her amused while we prep her food and she goes out of her way to hunt it down when she's just playing and not in the seat.

It positions your baby at the hip so you have more range of motion than if he was on your belly/chest as with other carriers.  I fully recommend the mei hip.

I'm giving up and ordering another one. Not bad for every day use for 10 months though. My original review:When our large 6 month old outgrew her tub we looked around at other inflatable tubs only to realize that the diameter they gave was for the outside so once it was inflated the actual tub size was even smaller than the infant tub we were using. We couldn't find the snug tub in any of the stores (Babies R Us carries their own brand, Baby Depot and Target only carried the Munchkin duck tub which is so small). With our 70 year old cast iron tub we definitely liked the idea of the inflatable tub to protect her little head from harm. She loves bath time so we wanted to make it as safe as possible. Well this tub is the answer. It is everything the reviewers have said - convenient (blow up once and store with suction hook), big (lots of room for toys and splashing), secure (fits very snugly, thus the name) and the bonus is obviously that you can travel with it. And if you pay the couple of dollars more to get the Snug Tub Deluxe versus the Snug Tub you get the toys. Not that I cared but she really does love the squeaking fish.

Just before putting her to sleep, our cat jumped in the basinette, and I was distraught thinking that she would do this again when the baby was asleep in it. Because we have a soft mattress, I couldn't bear the thought of my daughter sleeping with us, so I spend a sleepless night in the recliner with her on my chest.  First thing the next day, we went to the store, and bought the snuggle nest. The selling points for use were the size, and the light. It fit perfectly between us on our king size bed, and the light allows me to breastfeed and change the baby without overstimulating her. And because I had had a c-section, it was wonderful not getting out of bed all the time.   Two weeks later, I was ready to put her in the bassinette again.

I was hesitant to register for it in the beginning because of so many negative reviews. However, after trying it out, I've found that it is a pretty decent product. It's true that the wipes are warm only for a couple of seconds, but really, how long does it take to wipe a baby off? The owners manual states that the warmer is not meant to produce hot wipes. I think it is great to have something to remove the chill from the wipes, which should be comforting to the baby. When I first used it, I didn't add the water as suggested in the manual, just to see how it would work. The wipes did start to dry out after awhile but then I added the 1/2 cup of water and haven't noticed any more drying. All of the wipes are still moist. I haven't noticed any discoloration either and I am using Huggies wipes. My baby hasn't arrived yet but I wanted to try this out to see for myself how well it did or did not work.

Morales,"Dallas, TX USA","We purchased this in anticipation of our trip to Yellowstone next year. The pack is very comfortable when adjusted correctly. I find that if you adjust it right, most of the weight is placed on your hips. Our 9 month old girl loves to ride in it. She even fell asleep once. She seems to like the rhythm of our walk and even ""sings"" as she gets bounced around. We were worried that she wouldnt like it because she can be a pretty difficult baby (she was born with acid reflux). However, we have had it for several months now and she makes no complaint when we load her up. She doesnt even mind sitting in the pack when it is on the ground.I have very short hair and the baby likes to try to grab it (too short to really grab). Interesting enough, she never tries to grab my wife's hair. I would suppose that you may want to invest in a hat if your baby likes to pull hair.There are lots of pockets, although if you are wearing the pack, the pockets are very difficult to access, even the ones on the hip. The hip pockets seem too far back (I have a 38"" waist). My wife has a smaller waist and doesnt seem to have the problem with the waist pockets that I do.When taking off the pack, the baby seemed secure and getting her on and off was no problem.We dont use the hood. Its not too difficult to put on. Just takes a little time to figure it out.I am 5'10"" and the waist belt at near the lowest setting is just right for me. My wife is 5'7"" and she likes the waist belt setting near the middle-top.At first, it felt awkward walking with the weight, but after a couple of walks, we got used to it. Now we fight for who gets to wear the pack when we walk. Im glad we got the pack. We cant wait till we get to load her up at Yellowstone",United States,TX

I only wish I bought it sooner. I bought a cheap breast pump at first, but it broke down after only a month of use. Due to daycare issues, I had to leave my son with my parents for a week, so I had to pump exclusively. After the second day with the cheap pump, my milk production cut in half to about 3 oz total from both sides every 3 hours. Then I had to wait longer to even get that much! I went out and bought this pump out of desperation and couldn't be happier. It took me about 4 pumping sessions for my body to get into a rhythm, but then it was great. I started pumping more milk in less time than the cheap pump. Now I use the pump 2-3 times a day at work and occasionally on the weekends.A couple of tips: If you have larger breasts, buy the larger shields. I am a D cup and the 27 mm shields are perfect for me. As soon as I switched to the larger shields, the minor discomfort I had pumping went away and I started getting about another ounce of milk out on each side in the same amount of time. Also, to use the dual function, turn on the pump before you put the shields to your breast. I've been doing that and I haven't had a problem positioning them correctly with the pump on.I've never had a problem with cleaning the pieces. I make sure and give the pieces a really good washing once a day, but in between each pumping, I wash everything quick with soap and my hand and let it dry. I've never had a problem with the pieces not drying in time before the next pumping. Also, when I bought my pump, they included an extra set of membranes. You can also buy microwave sterilization bags from Medela to clean everything in, including the membranes, which can't go in the dishwasher. Also, since the pump works with any bottle, you don't have to continually wash one bottle to use with the pump. I just stick nipples on the bottles I pumped in and take them to daycare, then grab the next set of clean bottles out of the cabinet for the next day.I must say, this pump saved my milk supply. I even have a freezer full of extra breastmilk. Even though it is much more expensive than some of the other pumps, I've saved more than its cost in formula, so it's been worth it financially, not to mention the extra benefits of breastmilk that my son has continued to have. I plan on keeping mine for my next child and I would definitely recommend this product to other moms",United States,OK

And even then you'll want to check it with a friend listening on the phone for it first. Our battery pack didn't work at first and we didn't check it until we were on the road, so check yours. The white membranes also must be kept very clean and the yellow tips they go in. Even a little bit of old milk will completely kill the suction. But it is worth it even with this issue.

B0000AY9XY,Avent Newborn Starter Set: Baby,baby,1 of 1,4.0,They worked well for us.....,"January 11, 2007","Jennifer Rossi ""jennazer""","Pittsburgh, PA","We used Avent with our first son almost 5 years ago.  I did run into some leaking problems that came from the white cap screwing onto the bottle.  I found if I tightened the bottle a bit more it eliminated the leaks completely.  After figuring this out, we had no more problems.  We are expecting our second child in a few months and I have started to buy Avent again.  Our first son did not have a whole lot of gas problems.  Of course he was gassy at times, so I can't say he had no gas, but he didn't appear to have so much gas where it was bothering him.  I really liked the wide bottle with Avent.  It made it more comfortable for me to hold then later on when our son got to be old enough the wide bottle made it easy for him to hold.  Avent also has handles that attach to the bottles when your baby/toddler gets old enough to hold the bottle by themselves.  The handles were wide and colorful and made holding easy for little hands.  The nipples I did feel at first were a bit hard, but our son never had any problems taking it.  Of course, this will vary amoung babies. After just purchasing a 3 pack of 4 oz bottles for impending baby #2 I opened up the package after seeing the advertisement for ""extra soft nipple"" and it is indeed softer then it was 5 years ago.  If you are looking to save money, I suggest either buying very few 4oz bottles or simply buying the 9 oz or even 11 oz bottles instead as they outgrow the 4 oz very quickly.  We had no problems cleaning these bottle as well and they held up very well.  We never had to replace them.",United States,PA

The toys on the side are convenient because my little can only reach to the side (instead of straight in front or overhead). Also, it is easier to lift her out because they don't get in the way.

Yikes!  Needless to say, we were HIGHLY disappointed with Avent.  By the recommendation of our pediatrician, we went out and bought a new set of Dr. Brown's bottles---kine of pricey, but WORTH every penny!!  With Avent, my son was getting super gassy and colicky.  He would cry so hard with gas pains that he'd clinch his little fists, crunch his little legs to his tummy and practically go hoarse.  Burping, mylicon and gripe water didn't even help.  Our days and nights were sleepless--he wouldn't nap because he was crying--and our nights would average about 3-4 hours of sleep.  Now, with Dr. Brown's---our son is a NEW little man.  He STILL gets gas, but not like he did with the Avent bottles.  All it takes is a couple of little pats on his back and he gives us a couple of good burps and he's out into LA LA land---he's now able to take his naps and has been sleeping anywhere from 6-8 hours through the night now for the past 2 weeks---and he's only 1 month old. :)  For some reason, when he was feeding from the Avent, he would suck uncontrollably, I'd see lots of bubbles in his bottle and in the nipple and I could hear him sucking all that air in.

Pridgen ""bookworm4life""","Wray, GA","Hi,I have no idea if these bottles help a colic/gasey baby. My baby was never like that. I considered these bottles because I hated that my son had to suck till he could suck no more then let go of a nipple so air could back into a regualar bottle. So I started looking for a bottle that didn't have nipple collaspe. First we tried Playtex. They worked but were extremely hard to mix powdered formula in because the liners held exactly 8 oz (also expensive liners). Then I switched to Avent, thought it was my dream come true bottle. Until they started leaking no matter how I screwed on the ring. I finally figured out the problem, the skirts on the nipples warp after very little use. So I ended up constantly buying new nipples and never knowing when we would get a whole bottle dumped on us. So then Dr Brown came out with these wide neck bottles. After some reading the directions and trial and error; this is it: The Bottle for Us!! This is how we did it; you can't use the valve while mixing formula or warming or the bottle will leak. So water goes in the bottle and just the ring, nipple and cap get screwed on. The valve goes in a zip-lock bag. About ten minuetes before the bottle is needed. I but the formula in the bottle in and shake. In about ten minuets all the bubbles are down and I incert the valve and feed. No leaks. I have an aunt who premixes her formuala in two days worth of bottles and puts them in the fridge ( once again leaving the valves out). Then she gets them out, swirls a little, takes off the top, microwaves for 30 secs, incerts valve, checks tempreture and feeds. No leaks either. The only time I have ever had a leak is when I mixed or heated formula with the valves in which the directions say not to do. Like I said this is what works best for us",United States,GA

B00008614F,Playtex Premium Nurser Newborn Gift Set: Baby,baby,1 of 1,5.0,Great for the breastfeeding mom,"February 2, 2007","Pasilaly ""pasilaly""","Evanston, IL USA","I find these to be quite convenient for giving my baby breastmilk from the bottle. With the Playtex One-Step storage system, I pump directly into the liner and stick it in the fridge, and then I can pop it in a nurser when it's time to feed. My husband and other caregivers are quite glad at the ease of putting it all together when they're juggling a crying baby.As advice to others, I wonder whether the original nurser gift set might be better, because it comes with multiple different kinds of nipples, whereas this set only comes with the silicone slow flow. We've lucked out, in that my baby seems happy with it and switches easily from breast to bottle and vice versa; however, it might have been handy to be able to try different kinds to see which the babe likes best. The shells in this set are more modern looking, but I can't see how that matters. I'm pretty sure the pieces for both are interchangeable. Nice that the silicone nipples in this set (and all the other pieces; latex nipples are less hardy) are dishwasher safe, and can be repeatedly boiled for sterilization if desired. The short shells in this set are fine, and it's easier to reach in the bottom to squish the liner with your fingers (to help it collapse; the drop-in liners are relatively more shape-holding than regular liners, so they can suck in air), but usually my baby has more than 4 oz at a sitting; in the 8oz size shell, the burper is nice (it's hard to reach in when the liner is less full), but it doesn't squish the liner all the way, so we end up taking off the shell and using our fingers for the last 2 oz or so. I have never had any problem with leaking.I like the disposable bit of this system, since the nipples, collars, and lids take up enough space and cleaning effort without having a bunch of bottles around as well. Liners are pricy if you use a lot (about $5 for 50 at Walgreens), but since we only use a bottle a day, it doesn't seem like much. They also freeze easily. This set came with one adapter for a breast pump (I use an Ameda Purely Yours, and they fit together perfectly), and the One-Step comes with another, so I can use the double pumping without buying any other pieces. Overall, I'm very happy with this set",United States,IL

My husband prefers the soft bottle liners over the preformed dropins. The soft ones haven't leaked on us once but the formed ones have slipped out from under the ring a couple of times spilling formula everywhere. The formed ones also make it harder to screw the lid on tight enough causing leaks. The soft liners might take a little bit longer to put on the bottle and deal with, but in the long run it takes less time because you don't have to go change your clothes every time the preformed ones leak.

McDaniel,"OH, United States","We've been using our Diaper Dekor for more than two years now.  In all that time, the Dekor has held up wonderfully.  After hearing friends complain about the two-handed requirements of Diaper Genies and the like, we went with the Dekor because the easy, one-handed operation was appealing -- just stomp on the pedal and throw in the diaper.  We were also glad that the product was so well-reviewed; it turns out that those good ratings are very well deserved.Our Dekor works so well that we keep it in the family room, where we spend most of our time (bonus: we don't have to run upstairs every time we need to change a diaper!) -- and we certainly wouldn't do that if there were an odor problem.  The only time we've noticed any odor has been during the summer, when it's really hot and the contents get... ah... ripe faster, and even then it was only when the lid was open.  Other than a few super-hot weeks each year, we empty the Dekor once a week and all is well.The interior of the Dekor, where the diapers are collected, has gotten a touch stinky over the last couple years, but you don't smell it until you open the door to empty the unit.  A little Lysol helps, but frankly, as long as the smell doesn't ""escape"" the Dekor, it's a non-issue to us -- and so far, so good!The refills may seem more expensive than other systems, but they last FOREVER.  With my first son, we used only four refills in two years.I highly recommend the Dekor, and wouldn't even consider another diaper disposal system.

I actually like the positioning of double rail better than the single because it clamps onto the bottom of the mattress rather than the top which leave more room on the bed.

It didn't even require reading the directions (who has time for that when you have a baby after reading all of the parenting books and other safety manuals).

I really like how there is a very handy and very child safe cutting blade for the liners mounted onto the inside of the lower changing door.  I noticed some reviewers stating that they had problems with the item controling odor, while most other's have had no trouble at all.  Taking this into account, I purchased my Diaper Dekor with an open mind.  I had no trouble for the first 5 months.  Then I also noticed an odor in my son's room, even when the unit was empty, and after I had wiped down the outter lid, inner lid, and flaps, inside and out.  Then it occured to me:  There was condensation on the inside of the liner bag when I emptied it and then used the blade to cut it.  I wondered if maybe the bacteria or something from the moisture was now on the blade and then causing the smell.  So, I pumped some alcohol based hand sanitizer onto the blade to see what would happen.  The smell went away.  I then thought, ""That's just too easy, and a bit crazy.  It can't be that simple"".  So, I waited until I noticed the smell again a couple of months later.  I used the hand sanitizer again, and lo and behold, the smell once again went away.  The gist of it is, if you're going to put a wast material into something where it's going to sit for a few days before you get rid of it, it is going to start to decompose.  The Diaper Dekor is great at controlling those icky germs and bacteria and keeping them in one safe place.  The problem is, decomposisition creats heat, and the more decomposing solid matter, and the longer is sits, the warmer it all becomes.  So, if the temperature inside your waste recepticle is warmer (which it will be) than the surrounding room temperature, condensation will form. So when you cut the liner to empy the unit, clean the blade.  No odor.  No problems",United States,MN

The velcro is a life saver because most babies can break out of a blanket you've swaddled them in and then you worry that the blanket will smother them in the middle of the night. The only issue we had was when he got a little older and stronger, he would bust out his arm. Usually he would continue sleeping but sometimes it would wake him up. I'd take that any day over trying to deal with a regular blanket. It has an amazing calming effect and helps prevent them from waking themselves up with their arm and leg movements.

In comparison to a blanket, this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles.  I'm quite good with a blanket, but by six weeks of age, my son could wriggle out.  On the other hand, at three months, he's never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme.However, even in cold weather, the microfleece is too hot.  Several times I've felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty.  It's even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling.  On the other hand, the cotton knit (solid colors) blankets are too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga, leaving both arms flying free.  The cotton flannel (gingham prints) has less stretch than the other two fabrics, and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures.  It is trickier to find, but worth the search.The microfleece Swaddleme does, however, make a great non-swaddle blanket on cold days, particularly when the baby is in a front carrier.

As most babies are, he goes through several changes of clothing frequently.  I use this Tote bin as his laundry bin, and it works great!  i keep it next to his crib, and just throw whatever needs washing into it, clothes, bedding, toys, whatever.  After it is filled, it makes a good small/medium load for washing.  It is attractive looking, stands up well on its own, has 2 cutout reinforced holes for easy toting, and contains the messes well.  It also doubles as a toy/mess pickup bin, great to tote toys or other items in.  The size is not too deep to reach into, for adults or babies.  If you fill this tote w/ small toys, baby can play w/ it for quite a while, taking things out, putting things back in and looking at the mirror on the side.  Since it is a soft bin, no need to worry that baby would bump little head on it.  I think this is a better size/depth than the sea life pop up organizer.  I exchanged the organizer for this, and love the convenience of it(the organizer has no handle to tote around, and is too deep to get to for people w/ bad backs or small children).  I also have the matching toy box, which I also love very much.  they look great together in my son's nursury, both are durable, easy to clean, and safe for baby to play with",United States,CA

This is an umbrella stoller with all the bells and whistles.  It is light enough but yet has heft.  There is a detachable canopy... basket underneath... mesh baggy bottle holder... winter boot... rain cover and sun shade.  There is so much.  Where the child lays there is even a way to elevate the legs... you usually don't get that with the lighter strollers.  If it gets too hot in the summer, you can even remove some of the fabric on the seat so that it is ventilated.  I would say my favorite part is that on the canopy there is a zipper for parents to store what is necessary.  First time I have seen that.Haven't really tested it yet, but it seems to roll smoothly, close down easily and open just as easily.  I love the fact that I can push up the levers on the back of the stroller with my barefoot.... usually it hurts through my boots.  Great buy... you won't regret it.  The navy one really does look black, but the canopy seems navy.  The accents that look hot pink in the picture are actually red.  Good looking",United States,NY

The Bjorn is the original and I think the key to their popularity is the simplicity of the design.

Both my partner and I use the same one (easily adjusts for different size people) pretty much everywhere including sweeping and mopping the floors.

The swivel-wheel in front makes it super-easy to maneuver, turn, and steer.  I often see parents with the older-model BOB (pre-swivel) and they have to make awkward turns by rolling their joggers onto the back wheels.  What a pain! I'm SO glad I got the Revolution! Ours is the ""Mesa Orange"" color, but I think it reminds me of Tomato Soup, Reddish Orange, and not too bright. It reclines enough for my son to nap, and has a flap so I can look in on him. The only thing I would change is that the basket at the bottom is hard to access when my son is in the jogger. Also, if there were some sort of iPod attachment/pocket that would be a HUGE plus!  (Like the Jeep stroller has) But, I purchased some folding speakers, and used velcro to seucure them (temporarily) to the canopy. Now we have tunes on our walks!

We have a Peg car seat, and I didn't want to schlepp my Peg stroller through the airport, etc. while on vacation.

My husband also had a tricky time removing the plastic parts that you have to pull off in order to make this work with the Peg; once they were off, though, the stroller has been a breeze. I would give one word of warning: you do have to be careful with this stroller that it is (1) popped all the way open (there's an audible clicking noise when this happens) and (2) that the car seat carrier is strapped in.  The Peg carseat sort of just rests on top of the carrier, which makes it a bit susceptible to tipping over on uneven surfaces.",United States,IL

Eliason,Bria server,The Embrace is extremely comfortable. My wife loved it when compared to a friend's Medela. One complaint though....it does pump a little slower then other pumps.....but the extra comfort is well worth it!Playtex has awesome customer support. My wife accidently tore one of her valves (little white points that fit under each cup). She called playtex and they immediately FED EXed her 4 replcement valves for free. They only asked that we return the torn valve(s) for R&D. Be careful with the valves they are a bit fragile and if you tear one it adversely affects the suction of that cup.,Portugal,Portugal Continental

I used it with the One-Step Storage system, which made it easy for my husband to warm and give him his bottles while I was at work.  The cups were super-comfortable, and after some practice, I had no trouble getting letdown.  I could usually pump 4-6 oz per 15-20 minute session.  I haven't noticed that it is any noiser than my friend's Medela.  I haven't tried other electric pump, however, I did try an Avent ISIS manual pump and HATED it.

At first I was looking at pumps that cost around the $70 range.  I am so glad that I decided to spend the extra money!  My daughter was not too keen on breastfeeding and it just turned into a horrible experience that I'd like to forget.  The hospital that I was in provided the Medela pump.  Ouch!!!  My breasts were sooo sore from using that thing, it was not comfortable at all!  The cups for the breast is this hard plastic and when it would pump, my poor nipples were getting so sore and then i had to use nipple cream to make them feel better.  I actually could not have anything on my breasts while i was at the hospital because they were so sore.  It made me so grouchy and I just let everything hang out.  I didn't care who came in the room!!!  When I came home and started using the Playtex pump, it was such a relief!  The cups for the breasts have a soft rubbery feel to them and they didn't stretch or pull my nipples while pumping.  The 5 speed/suction controls are very nice to have.  It does come with a storage kit but it only provides 4 storage thingy's.  I had to buy 2 extra storage kits so that I had enough contraptions to use for storing milk.  I really hope that makes sense!  And then there's the liners.  I had liners coming out of my ears!  I guess that's how Playtex makes their money, you have to buy tons of liners (and don't forget the storage kits).  The pump is a little loud when the suction is set higher.  I used it for 4 months and everything worked great.  I definitely recommend this pump.  I would have given it 5 stars but my only gripe is spending the extra money on storage kits and the countless number of liners you have to buy.  BUT... It is a world of difference between Medela and Playtex. ",United States,OR
B0000TYHD2,Playtex Embrace Breast Pump System: Baby,baby,24 of 24,5.0,Worth every cent ~ going strong after 5 months w/twins,"June 4, 2006","Jaana K. Gilbert ""Mother of twin girls""","Salisbury, NC","I love this pump. I've tried Medela and hospital grade pumps and this is by far the most comfortable pump ever.I'm the proud mom of almost 5 month old twin girls and I used hospital pump which got me bleeding on second day. Problem, flangies were too small for me and they didn't have anything larger. Embrace is the right size for me and after getting home from the hospital on the 3rd day I have been married to my pump 24/7. We had latching problems so I was never able to fully nurse my babies, but with Embrace I'm still going strong after 5 months and pump 50-60oz/day. I have had NO problems with my pump, no motor failures, no tube problems, nothing. I've pumpped with it like I said, almost 5 months on average 5 times a day. It may be a bit noisy... my husband calls it a respirator :) But I would not switch my pump to Medela or any other for anything.I'm sorry some of you have had bad experience with your Embrace, not everybody's body is made the same and not every manufacturing lot is the same, I'm sure of that. This pump has been a life saver for me and my girls and I have no plans on stopping pumping.I started with the 4oz bottles that came with the system and eventually graduated pumping into Dr.Brown's 8oz bottles. I love the fact that I can pump directly to both narrow and widemouth bottles. I've never cleaned my pump nor bottles in the dishwasher, but wash them by hand.I started working when my girls were 9 weeks old, so I guess I can be called a WAHM (I'm a web developer and work from home) and I didn't notice any drop in supply during the work day compared to the weekend.WORTH EVERY CENT!

B0007Z2JMA,Kiddopotamus & Co Rayshade® Double Uv Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection For Twin Strollers And Twin Joggers Navy: Baby,baby,12 of 13,4.0,great protection but has room for improvement,"January 24, 2006",Biggi,Hawaii,"I have a graco side by side stroller.Like with most strollers, the canope on this stroller is almost useless. Why is it so hard for the companies to figure out what we Mom's really want? A functionable canope would be one thing for example. On most strollers they are a joke.So I bought this sunshade.Positive: folds up flat and easily;attaches easily (though you may have to fiddle a bit to find the best position);side pockets are a nice extra and help to weigh the shade down some as well ( and you can perhaps hide some goodies in there because they are really not easy to spot );it shelters from the side as well;Negative:Hello.. a slight wind and this thing bends backwards or moves sideways;When the sun comes from the front, while setting, you can't really pull it down far enough to protect your children.Living on an island we deal with wind all the time and so it is not as practical as I would like this shade to be.But still would recommend it over leaving the child just exposed.Perhaps if you have less wind to deal with you really will like this shade.I gave it a 4 star because it does protect my children and that is what matters.You deal with the negative points,but I wished it would have been designed for all weather. I don't see how you can attach a weight and still allow it to stand up correctly.The material is too thin for that.But I am open for ideas and suggestions.I don't have problems folding the stroller together while shade is attached. Perhaps that is just a matter of trying and see what you prefer and like.All in all it is worth the money and afford because your little ones deserver and need the proctection.Till the strollers are made with better canopes, we will have to rely on something like this.I also have the Peg Perego Aria stroller and had bought the single one for that one.Same issue, problems with wind but otherwise a nice protection.And yes you will have to fold it back when you put baby in.Perhaps that was the main concern of the designer.

I really like the fact that Symphony in Motion is award winning but the biggest drawback to that one is the fact that it can actually keep babies awake because of how active it is.  And I like the Ocean Wonders mobile because of the ceiling projection but the drawback there is that people said you pretty much have to have the room pitch black dark to see those images well.  Since we keep a night light on for our little one, we decided against that one too.  In the end, we chose the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile because it seemed to be the most soothing and we were NOT disappointed.

There is a foam wedge at the foot end to prevent baby from ""scootching"" out of it.  HOWEVER, this makes the sleeper short enough to only last maybe 3 months (more or less, depending on the length of the baby).  I've read that other buyers had a ""split mattress,"" but mine was not split, but was one piece.  After being folded, it was obviously bent in the middle, but I solved that by just flipping the mattress over for that use.  I suppose that the split mattress was designed after complaints of the mattress being bent, so not a great change in my opinion.  I also liked the nightlight - just bright enough to let us see the baby, without waking her up fully.It is sized so that it would best fit in a king size bed (if you have 2 parents in bed), but we managed with a queen.  After reading other reviews, and thinking about my own use of this sleeper, I've come to a conclusion:  The length may be too short to use it for long, however, once baby outgrows it lengthwise, it's probably time to get him out of your bed, as he is too mobile to be in a sleeper of this design.  So perhaps good planning on The First Years part ",United States,IA

This potty is easy to clean and very easy for the little ones to use all by themselves. My son will be 3 in 4 months(and he is big for his age) and this potty is not too little for him. He loves the music and it is not distracting to him or too much fun. I however did not use the splash guard as I didn't see the need so I dont know if it falls off easily or not. We had tried everything to potty train him and this chair along with letting him go without pants or diapers on or making sure his training pants are easy for him to pull up and down is the only thing that has worked. He gets to use it by himself and he even dumps it into the real toilet afterwards and he gets very excited about it,United States,TX

I have loved it from the day my daughter was born, almost 2 years ago, and am now using it with my son.  It's very lightweight and easy to steer.  I never have a problem maneuvering it through the mall or in stores, even in the tightest of spaces.  My daughter loves that she can sit forward and see the world around her, and I love that she can be buckled into a 5 point harness at the same time!!!  After 2 years of pretty constant use and being tossed into and pulled out of my car trunk and my husband's truck, the stroller still looks brand new.  The fabric is easy to clean and very durable.  I can understand the remarks about the cup holder and basket being on the small side.  If these particular features are on your ""most important"" list, I might think about buying a full-sized stroller or travel system, not one of the Italian brands.  Europeans just don't understand our fascination with gallon-sized cup holders and enormous storage baskets...just look at their cars and you'll understand.  However, if you're looking for a stroller that can function well both as your everyday standard stroller and as your travel lightweight stroller, go with the Aria. ",United States,VA

The pillow velcros on so you can remove it if your little one wants to practice holding themselves up or just for a wash.  As far as the new water everyday thing goes. I was good about that in the beginning believing it might turn green or fog up or something. It turns out nothing horrible will happen if you don't change it very often. Actually the ability to empty it is helpful if you plan on taking it with to say grandma's house. Very easy to roll up and take with unlike our playmat.

Flat on his stomach when he couldn't hardly raise his head at all just freaked him out and he'd cry and cry.  But with the little raised pillow, it would keep him from having his face smoshed into the floor and he'd be more patient with trying to look around.  Now that he's 4 months and able to lift his own head fine he doesn't really need the extra booster pillow, and he didn't start playing with the water bit until 3 months.  Plus the velcro on one of the toy links wouldn't hold.  But the little attached toys are very nice - we made a belt for his infant carrier and put them there where he plays with them all the time.   But I think it's very nice for a baby as they learn head control so that it lifts them a bit off the ground so they don't panic as much",United States,MD

Funkhouser,"Toney, AL USA","This seat is for our 3 month old daughter who weighs 15 pounds. First, I'll point out the pros of this bouncer seat. The music is wonderful. The waterfall is captivating. The colors are mesmerizing. She can sit in the seat for 25 minutes easily. The seat takes 4 D-size batteries. Unlike other bouncer seats we have used, there is only one compartment for 4 D-sized batteries. Unlike its predecessor (the Ocean Wonder Aquarium), the Rainforest bouncer keeps our child AWAKE. If we wanted our child to sleep, we'd put her in bed, not the bouncer. So Fisher Price definitely got it right this time! A++!The cons is that the seat was used twice before it started to make this loud clicking noise from the bar. Being an engineer, I took it apart and noticed that the gears are designed to click (or skip a gear) if a child were to grab the frog or the monkey while it is moving. This prevents the gears from being stripped or the motor overheating. However, the tension on this ""gear skipping"" behavior is too sensitive such that after 3 hours of use, the clicking occurs from just the friction of the frogs moving up and down on the bar.I called customer support about the clicking and they promptly sent a replacement bar. After 2 weeks of using the new bar, it started clicking. Argh! The good thing is that the new bar does it randomly. We're willing to live with the flaw and the annoying clicking from time to time for the Pros listed above.The other con is questionable. There is much debate about the height of the toys on the bar. Being an ""infant"" bouncer, it is designed such that the child can grab the toys and even pull the rings off the monkey. Our daughter loves it! We do have the Fisher Price ""Kick and Play"" which is designed for slightly older children in that it provides more clearance between the child and the toys ... hence ""Kick and Play.""The bouncer comes with a one-year warranty. So for a year, I can get replacement bars as the clicking becomes annoying. After replacing enough of them, will their engineers will fix the problem? I hope so.19 March 2007:The clicking has returned with the replacement bar and won't go away. I called Fisher Price for a replacement bar. While they really wanted to send a voucher for $48, I pressed to have another toy bar sent as a replacement. At that point, customer service informed me that there is a backlog of replacements on this bar till 30 April 2007. Customer service continues to be very friendly and easy to deal with.

Amazon doesn't sell the new model apparently and I don't know what the differences between them are.  I checked the Fisher-Price website and it doesn't say, but they list both models.  I ordered mine from Amazon on March 9, 2007.The chair was exactly what we were looking for.  Our dining area is fairly small so using our existing dining chair does save space.  The booster chair feels secure as it secures both behind and under the dining chair with buckle straps.  It also has non-skid rubber feet on the bottom of all four corners.  The 3-point to 5-point harness is helpful for keeping the baby in place.  We were using one of those cheapy plastic block booster chairs and our 7-month old kept slouching underneath the tray.  The countoured seat in the Space Saver High Chair helps to prevent that.The adjustable height was useful for raising the tray to just above our table level so we could slide the whole chair underneath when not in use.  I'm not sure when we'd recline the seat, but I guess it's a nice option to have.The chair reminds me of a car seat, and as such, keeps our baby in place while feeding.  The one-handed release of the tray and the highly adjustable settings are convenient options.  I don't think I could ask for anything more out of a booster chair.  Perhaps a built-in iPod adapter with speakers built into the tray or something.  Just kidding :",United States,CA

B0009OLSZ8,BABYBJÖRN Potty Chair - White: Baby,baby,6 of 6,5.0,Great potty!,"February 9, 2007","Pyneitha Rogers ""Midwest Mommy""","Wichita, KS","I recently purchased this potty for my 16 month old son. We are not actively training but I wanted to introduce him to it. The first night I got it, he went pee pee and boo boo in it. I screamed and clapped and sang a little song. He really likes it. He even brought it out of the bathroom and took it into the living room to watch The Wiggles while sitting in it. I like the color, and how it fits his size(He's 27lbs and 32 inches tall). He can sit on it and get up all by himself. Its very sturdy, it doesn't wobble or tip over like some do. My son has even held onto one of the sides (while sitting on it) and leaned over to pick up one of his books and the potty didn't tip at all. One reviewer said the splashguard was a little short, but I haven't had a problem. My son tends to look down at himself while he's going, so everything is pointing south anyway. I love that there are only 2 pieces to this chair. Very easy to clean. I had a safety 1st chair with the flip top lid and the detachable splashguard and I absolutely hated this thing. My son would pull off the splashguard and walk around the house with it. He was too concerned with the lid and turning around on the chair to pull the lid up and down instead of concentrating on trying to go potty. With the baby bjorn there are no distractions, no music, no removable pieces(except the bowl)which allows him to focus on going potty.  I just really like this potty chair. I would highly recommend this chair",United States,KS

When he tires of staring at the wide array of toys that are attached to the playard and playing with them he rolls over and pushes on the aqua part of the mat(his favorite part) then he rolls back over and stares at the lights and dancing fish on the detachable music box and happily laughs and kicks the cloth poles that hold the soft child safe and friendly toys above his head, he loves being able to control the movements of the toys above his head so much... and the cloth covered poles do not scare me as muc as the typical plastic ones, lastly he looks at himself in the mirror as he drifts off to sleep.

I have a 2 1/2 year old son and six month old daughter.  We graciously accepted my sister's hand me down Evenflo 'Take me Two' double stroller before the arrival of my daughter.  Not only was that ridiculously hard to move (it weighs 47lbs), but my son (weighing 35 lbs) would throw a 2 year year old fit and end up kicking the back seat of his sister's chair and send her flying forward.  My children are both super tall and heavy.  After loading them into my suv, loading the stroller was like a joke!  After some extensive research, my Joovy arrived two days ago and have used it on a crazy expedition to Walmart (one week before Christmas, mind you!).  My 2 year old is extremely picky and he hopped right in, and rode the whole time.  He felt he was a 'big boy' and my daughter rested happily in the universal car seat attachement bar.  She is also big enough to just sit up, so that is what I will try next.  Both kids were comfy, content, and safe.  It glides with ease, is a BREEZE to open and close (lift up two small levers with your fingers and it collapses).  The construction is obviously very sturdy and high quality.

Granted, this took a few overheated bottles and a little practice to get it right.  At first, we were pretty p.o.'d that we couldn't get this thing to heat consistently (my wife is a doc and I'm a lawyer so you'd think between the two of us we could heat up four ounces of milk, but nooooo--apparently you need a PhD in nuclear physics to accomplish this).  After about ten tries, I started to get the feel for it, and now, I don't even measure the water- I just dump a bunch in and start counting.  Going by time produces much more consistent results than relying on the water measuring, which if done with exact precision would probably work perfectly.  For me, holding el porko in one arm and manipulating the faucet and water measuring flask is a bit rough, so again, for me, just counting off ten alligators and pulling the bottle works great.  I'd recommed that the company devise a flask that utilizes a sliding mechanism and slot so that you get an exact amount of water each time with excess water spilling-off.  As a sidenote, we use chilled expressed milk in Avent bottles and I find that: 1. leaving the lid on the bottles makes it easier to remove the four ounce bottles from the steaming warmer; 2. squeezing the nub? (the bulge right below the nipple tip) of the Avent bottle releases pressure built up by heating; 3. swirling the bottle gently after pulling it from the warmer is a good thing; and 4. a once a week cleaning seems to be about all the maintenance this thing needs.I griped to my mother about the sometimes inconsistent heat, to which she laughed and told me, ""go boil some water, pour it in a cup, drop your bottle in, wait 10 minutes for the bottle to warm up, clean up the mess you made, then complain to me how hard you have it.""  Point well taken.  Thinking about it, you'd need some sort of temperature probe or something to monitor the milk temp itself to really get exact results every time.  Maybe they'll have some doodad like that by the time I have grandkids.This warmer, Avent bottles, and the hard-to-find Gerber Anti-Gas Relief Simethicone drops have made my life much, much easier (oh yah, and lots of Excederine and coffee too).

Now with another child, I decided I can splurge on a new one since the bottom was starting to burn out a bit. I highly recommend it. The bottles warm in about a minute and is very easy. It's all easy to do while holding a baby in one hand too. The only negative I see if I've yet to master how much water to throw in. It works by putting in a small amount of water right into the unit and then it heats up essentially steaming the bottle so it's an even warming process. The problem is most likely me because I never pay attention to how much water I'm putting in to note for the future if it was right or not. But worst case I do a little more a second time, or give a minute to cool down. Usually it's perfect. With all the choices out there, I highly recommend this one.",United States,ME

My 19 month old gave it his seal of approval when he refused to get out of it the first time he went for a ride.  If he even sees it, he wants in it!The main differences between the 2007 and the 2006 are:1.  Increased seat recline of up to 70 degrees (earlier versions only recline to 45 degrees)2.  Increased back support on the seat back3.  Additional padding added to the seatQuite frankly, these improvements weren't a huge selling point for me.  If my son was an infant, the increased seat recline might matter, but at his age he doesn't want to recline at all.The sun canopy is the biggest I've ever seen on a stroller.  In the past I've had to put a blanket over the canopy to try and shield the sun from my son's eyes, but this canopy solves that problem.  It is huge!As for maneuverability, the Revolution far surpasses any other stroller I've tried.  It is a smooth, steady ride.  I typically use the swivel feature, but the stroller is still great with the front wheel in the locked position.The storage basket is fairly large for a jogger and is sufficient for the typical walk or jog.  I did take this stroller to the mall today and, while it was incredibly easy to maneuver through the mall, the storage basket was not large enough for shopping and storing packages along the way.It is very easy to fold and is fairly compact when it is folded, but it does not have a latching feature which makes picking it up a bit awkward.  It's not a huge deal to me, though, since I usually leave it open and ready to go in our garage (thank God for 3-car garages!).I really like the 5 point harness and my son doesn't mind being buckled into the seat.  He seems very comfortable and snuggles right in as soon as I put him in.  The ""cup holders"" inside the seat are nice, but he has a hard time getting his cups into them which tends to frustrate him.  An older child may not have an issue with this, though.The shock absorbers are really nice and work very well.  We can ""off road"" in it and still have a nice smooth ride.  If I hit an uneven area of pavement or branches/roots on the trail, it is barely noticeable.Overall I am very happy with this stroller.  And, more importantly, it got my son's seal of approval",United States,FL

B00005BR9R,Click N Go - Stroller Accessory System: Baby,baby,2 of 2,5.0,GREAT accessory on my Combi Savvy EX stroller,"July 2, 2006",L. Tapia,"Dallas, Texas","I picked this up at my local BRUs store.  I've had the snack cup only going on 6 yrs now on an umbrella stroller and got this set for my 3rd child's new Combi Savvy EX stroller.  The stroller came with a soft pack accessory holder that angled with the handles of the stroller but I needed more drink holders for my 2 older children and us adults.  It has WORKED PERFECTLY for us and I didn't have any problems installing the clamps - more details on that later. The very dark navy set (as pictured) blends well with my black & silver stroller.  This is what the set comes with and what it's for:1) 2 clips/clamps with large & small crews (used large screws to fit around the oval tubing of my stroller) and an allen wrench.  I think more clips would've been nice so people could use more of the attachments so I'm going to try to find long screws to replace the small screws I used on the clip on my old umbrella stroller. 2) 3 different sized ""C"" shaped bottle holders (pop bottle in at the neck) Use small size for normal water bottles, medium for Gerber styled baby bottles & wide-mouthed water bottles (i.e. Propel & Gatorade) and large for Avent style baby bottles.  3) A big cup holder - it was already assembled so we haven't had problems with the arms popping out, as other reviewers have stated.  It can be attached to the clips on 2 sides, one where the cup can swivel (why??? I don't know) or the other where it's stationary.4) Double-cupped snack cup with connected lids that swivel open.5) A mesh bag that is small (7 x 9.5 inches) but people - I think this bag is to hold all the attachment parts!6) 2 large ""S"" hooks and 2 small ""S"" hooks.  They do look flimsy but they work.  Keep in mind, you aren't supposed to load up your stroller with heavy items anyway (so it won't tip over) so don't expect to hang your loaded cooler on it!  We used both large hooks, one with a bag that held my Bjorn baby carrier and the other with a bag of snacks & small pint sized water bottles in it.  I do have the multi-colored ""S"" hooks from another manufacturer - they are very sturdy and do swivel but they will not fit on the tubes of this stroller.  NOTE: I have not seen large enough hooks for the aluminum oval tubes of these newer strollers. So these will be very useful b/c the basket underneath our stroller does hold a good amount but not enough for a productive day at the mall :-)Other reviewers have rated this item low for what I think are unwarranted reasons or high expectations of an after-market stroller accessory.  This item will not work on EVERY stroller out there.  Yes, the big cup holder will stick out a bit but at the zoo or mall we haven't had anything fall out.  Put some forethought into placement of the clamps and you won't be frustrated putting them on. RE: Installation:  I recommend closing your stroller first and look it over for possible locations of the clamps.  Then when first installing the clamps, test the closing of your stroller before totally tightening the screws.  On our Combi, it goes right above the clamps that you pull that closes the stroller and right under the included accessory pack.  Later when our baby starts eating snacks I can see a possible place for it right next to the seat frame but then the front rail of the stroller does have 2 cup holders on it so I think we'll really end up keeping the 2 clips up top for us.  The location it's at now is angled and yes, your attachments will end up holding your drinks straight.  The attachment pieces have an octagonal shape so when you pop the piece in, it can be straight.  Taking the piece off is easy, you only need to hold the clamp with one hand and pull the piece off with another.  DON'T FORGET to take these attachments off before closing the stroller and throwing it in the trunk of your car b/c the items may pop-off and get lost or they may break.This set has REALLY WORKED WELL for us and the price is good.  We were set with drinks for the whole family for a full day at theme parks and the zoo! Good luck",United States,TX

Angst,"DE, USA","I'm a mechanical engineer and after reading the other reviews, I thought I'd have to pull out my tools to make this thing work on our Peg Perego P3 stroller.  In fact, it went on quite easily.  The key is to locate the clamps just below P3 logo on the brace that goes down toward the rear wheels.  This allows the stroller to be folded up without removing the clamp - even if you have the large accessories like the snack tray or cup holder attached.  I did have to slightly angle the cup holder out when the seat was reclined all the way back (because we snap in the car seat currently with our infant).  I could not attach the clamps anywhere else on the stroller though due to the large oval tubing and necessity of folding it up.I'm impressed with the quality of the unit though.  Do be sure to use the long bolts since the oval-shaped tubing makes it a little difficult to connect the two halves of the clamp.  It would be even better if ""ClicknGo"" included bolts that were 1/4"" longer so you wouldn't have to strain to pull the halves together. ",United States,DE

You do need to test the positions before you tighten the clamps to make sure they won't interfere with closing of the stroller.  We placed one clamp on the side so our daughter could access either her sippy cup or the snack tray depending which we had attached at the time, and the other clamp on one of the stroller handles so we could attach the cup holder or water bottle holder for our use.  We spent a few days at Disney World and had no problems with the attachments falling off or knocking into things.  You do need to remember to remove and store the attachments before folding the stroller so they don't get knocked off and lost.

One of the best features are the rubber tires - they're noiseless and easy to push on any terrain. When I used the infant carrier it snapped in place super easy. I took this stroller to the beach at least 3 dozen times last year and it has weathered sun, sand and a wet toddler napping in it. The fabric dries easily. The cupholders and removeable snack tray are great. It folds easily. The storage basket is huge. It's also lightweight for it's comfortable size and extra features.",United States,GA
B000BPQH60,Graco Central Park Metrolite Stroller: Baby,baby,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent if you don't mind large size,"November 5, 2006",Sally Ryan,Northern California,"I've owned this stroller for more than two years and have used it almost every day, typically strolling two miles per day, often with lots of groceries in the storage basket. My toddler also takes her naps in the Graco (won't nap anywhere else). One little piece just broke and it's not a safety issue but I'm taking the opportunity to shop for a smaller stroller. Reading reviews of other strollers, including pricey ones, made me appreciate the Graco even more. I do wish it was a little more narrow to maneuver through tight store aisles, and to take up less room in my house, but I have no other complaints. Here's a list of pros and cons...Pros:- Rides very, very well. Durable up and down curbs. - Large storage area accommodates up to three bags of groceries.- Toddler is comfortable and naps in stroller.- Reclines easily and folds pretty easily.- Two cup holders in back and one in front tray which clicks off on one side to remove child more easily.- Window in back to view child through shade.- Adjustable handle is good for tall people (I'm 5'10"" and push it comfortably).  - Works with Graco car seat for newbornsCons:- Quite wide. Sometimes hard to fit through aisles of small neighborhood stores and takes up a lot of space in home and car trunk. - Doesn't accommodate newborns without car seat. - Shade doesn't fully shield child until he/she is quite tall. Until about one year of age, I draped a light blanket over the shade when necessary. ",United States,CO

Nanas ""Reviewing only what nobody else does""","Brooklyn, NY","I was actually pretty impressed by this potty, and just happened across Amazon to see what the price was here (I had to buy it at a B&M, and wanted to double check to see if I overpaid).This was for Child #2.  Child #1 had a potty, but was potty trained in the span of a week and never even sat on it (she used training seats instead).  Child #2, well, not so good.After a few weeks of unsuccessful attempts at the training seat, I decided to get him a potty.  Had I read the reviews here first, I never would have bought this one.  Luckily, the B&M was my first stop and I ended up with two of these potties (one for home, one for grandma).Pros:Works as advertisedEasy assembly and cleanupDecent battery lifeInexpensiveCons:The musical fanfare that follows a successful 'drop' isn't foolproof, and will sometimes fail to activate.Deflection cup in the front is a little awkwardly placed, causing some collision (do I have to elaborate on that one? :)Summary:It's under twenty bucks, assembles in minutes, and doesn't eat batteries.  OK, sometimes the music won't work - it's not exactly a high precision laser sensing toilet (if such an animal exists).  It'll still work 90% of the time.  I had bought the expensive potty for Child #1, and trust me - although it cost more than double the price of this unit, there were no appreciable differences between the two.It's easy to clean, inexpensive, and works as advertised.  I wish more kids items managed to meet these simple requirements",United States,NY

B000CSBOBO,BABYBJÖRN Toilet Trainer - White/Blue: Baby,baby,1 of 1,4.0,Best Child's Toilet (seat) Trainer,"March 3, 2007",P.W.,Wisconsin,"Since I consider this expensive I gave it 4 stars...(I wish there was a 4 1/2 star rating, it is better than 4 stars) Besides the expense, I'm quite happy with this product.  There is nothing else on the market like it...so, we went ahead & purchased it. This is an adjustable child's toilet seat that fits onto a regular toilet.  Because toilets come in different sizes/etc. there is a dial(near the handle) which you turn to make the trainer seat fit snug on the toilet.  I have found it is easy to place on the toilet plus it is so easy to remove.  Some other brands of child's toilet seats are very difficult to remove.  The BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer also has an oval shape opening...child's head won't fit through it.  A child might try to wear it as a ""hat"" but it will not go down over their head & around the neck.  Neither our son or daughter have had any problems using this seat/trainer.  It is easy for them to place on the toilet and remove. Our children do look so much more ""comfortable"" sitting on this Toilet Trainer seat instead of sitting/falling into the toilet when using a regular/adult size toilet seat.  Before purchasing this I also checked out the Toilet Trainer at the BabyBjorn website.  I was impressed with the information there.  I recommend people consider purchasing the Toilet Trainer.",United States,MN

Color samera picture looks like there is some oil on the lens or something - not necessarily grainy, just smudged looking.  I have returned it for a new one to see if the color one I had was defective. I didn't see why the picture quality would differ.  We'll see!  Also, you never get much color so don't' buy it for that.  We didn't care about the color as much as the size/portability of the monitor.  Also, you can easily plug it into the TV if you want the picture on the TV instead of the monitor.  Very cool idea.But overall we love these monitors. The black and white one is crystal clear, excellent sound, and good reception too.  You do have to move the monitor around sometimes if something else interferes with it but this has been a very minor problem in our house.  Also, if you walk in the monitor and camera path it sometimes gets static. Again, rarely a problem.  And ours sits right near our phones, computers, etc.We have two monitors and can switch the A and B channels to see each of the kids rooms which is so convenient.  Definitely a ""can't live without it"" item for our family. Although the regular black and white one is good enough if you don't care about portability/counter space.Also, we have had a great experience with Summer Infant customer service.  After having the black and white monitor for a long time we noticed a low pitched hum and they sent us a replacement very quickly, no problem. ",United States,

After reading some reviews about injuries and mishaps from jumping into the door frames, we firmly decided against that and researched floor models.We were between this Jumperoo and another one that has 4 support poles as the base.  The square Jumperoo didn't have nearly as many toys for her to discover and it seemed to take up much more space.  We decided on this Jumperoo because it took up less room and had more toys for only slightly more money.  The investment was worth it for just the first 10 minutes of fun!When we first put her in, she wasn't quite sure what to make of it and just looked around at the toys grabbing for them.  After she realized (in the first 2 minutes) that she could jump, she did with great joy.  Her face was all smiles and watching her kick her feet out while jumping had us all rolling on the floor hysterically.The toys she likes best are the ones that spin and she reaches for the parrot and frog that hang.  The tiger that comes up when you push on the button seems pretty useless, as does the color wheel.The whole thing took us about 10 minutes to put together and another few minutes to wash the toys.  Remember not the submerge the electronic one and to put 3 AA batteries in it.  The box does not include the batteries and you'll need a screwdriver to remove the battery cover.  Also, the large spinning ball has a rainbow sticker along the sides that if you don't dry right away, well, they'll start to wrinkle.  The Jumperoo does fold up for easier carrying/stowing but it's not a smooth transition.  I don't see us doing it that often however.As I mentioned, the entertainment that the adults got was well worth the cost initially.  And now, our baby girl has a great time bouncing on it while strengthening her legs.  She doesn't seem to like jumping without an audience but maybe she will when she gets a little older.

Frankly, the Dekor and the Champ both smelled (and ""smell control"" is the reason I want one of these), so those two now serve as garbage pails in other areas of our home. The Genie is good at controlling odor, but the top is a pain to use, and the top on my Genie broke after about 2 months, so another one bites the dust. As for controlling odor, Genie and NEAT are both the best (they both seal off the bad stuff with different ""sealing-off"" mechanisms that the other models just don't have). And features other reviewers have commented that they like about the Genie are also in the NEAT system:-put a dirty diaper into a clean bag every time-plunge the top to contain the smell and section off the mess- change the bag every few days to a week. (Our 16-month old is in daycare M-F, so we only change our two NEATs once a week. And never a smell. Ever.-easy to replace the liners. Takes 30 seconds. (No smell when changing it, either).Plus...-the handle/plunger on the NEAT is easier to use one-handed than the Genie. Just push and pull. No grappling to get the top off or the bag to grab the diaper and start twisting (with a dirty diaper in one hand and a squirmy baby at the other).-less plastic is wasted because it pushes straight down. The Genie rotates plastic on plastic which sends more down the chute.  As you can see, I've dumped a ton of money into this wisdom. But now, I finally have a stink-free environment in my son's room, and so far, nothing on the NEAT has broken (I'm only afraid that because it's an underdog, they're going to discontinue it, and then the refills will be hard to find).  - If that happens, I would try another Genie and hope the lid holds out.  I rank the Genie #2 out of all of these models",United States,OK

What you have to do is Fold the diaper together with the wipes that you use, and you would see the difference... I use to change it every 2 days, now It gets full every 4 days.... The refills are not expensive at all, and you could always get free refills at Babies R Us, buying 2 or 3 together....I use one refill every 3 weeks or so....I haven't try any other one in the market, but for me this is perfect, so I could say that is the BEST OPTION!!",United States,NJ

His bright colors are quite captivating, and his squeaky tummy usually makes her giggle.

B000E9T8GO,Evenflo SimpleStep Pressure Gate Taupe: Baby,baby,2 of 2,4.0,Bang for the Buck,"September 5, 2006",Lin,USA,"Overall this is a good gate.  I use it for a puppy, so it's a much more different experience for me than using it as a ""baby gate"".The intstalation was easy.  At first I thought the gate was broken becuase the latch didn't meet and the upper end stuck out farther than the lower ends.  THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY.  I just want to make that clear.  When you fasten it to the wall, the pressure pushes the top together so that it can latch.Use of the product was a litlle hard.  The latch requires you to push in two buttons (pinch them between your index and thumb) pull it to the side (left or right depending on a few things) WHILE holding the buttons.  And pushing it forward or towards you.  It sounds hard.  And at first is.  But you'll get the hang of it.  Using 2 hands if you can makes it easier.Quality of the product is great.  It has withstood a lot.  But keep in mind I have a 5 pund puppy not a 10+ pound child.One other thing I MUST note is that there is a bar along the bottom that touches the floor.  It is VERY easy to trip over.  And when you do, it hurts.  Don't let this factor alone deter you from buying this gate.  It's a good and relativly inexpensive product and one of the only decent pressure mount gates out there that I could find",United States,

I have kept the handle in what the instructions refer to as the A position which is also the setting that you carry the seat in. After speaking to a police officer recently trained and certified in car seat installation/safety, he said the handle absolutely needs to be as far back as possible and provided a very strong arguement why.  The manual that came with the seat is very ambiguous and does not specifically say this at all.  I called Graco and suggested that this statement be added to the book for safety concerns and she argued that the seat was ""tested"" with the handle being up and it was fine.The officer I spoke to was adament that an infant could be in GRAVE danger if the handle is up in a crash.

Our infant Graco Snug Ride carseat actually fits into the stroller (facing whomever is pushing). My husband loves the iPod connection, it works well as best I can tell. The tires are easy to inflate, I was able to figure out the air pump to inflate the tires with out any instructions. I also find that it has a lot of storage capacity for shopping. It is not super easy to steer with one hand as I sometimes have to do when my baby wants out. The stroller is heavy to lift in and out of the trunk and it does not fit in all cars. It can be awkward to lift and stowe ( watch your fingers )and it takes up a lot of space. It does collapse using one hand, but its not as if you could do it while holding your baby or anything else so it might as well be two handed) Also, I find that it is not the best a steering in small isles in stores, it tends to get hung up. However, it will ride over most terrain quietly and with little disturbance to your little one. It has two cup holders in near the handle, but I find that they are usually too small.

B000F0KHI0,Lambs & Ivy Rhyme Tyme 6 Piece Bedding Set: Baby,baby,2 of 2,5.0,Wonderful crib set but accessories only so-so,"March 8, 2007","Coffee Drinker ""Momof1""",MO,"I recently purchased this 6 piece set, along with the lamp, hamper & mobile, for our nursery.The colors are vibrant pastel pinstriped shades of blue, sage green, and tangerine with touches of bright yellow.  I like that brand new from the package, the material is touchable and isn't stiff as a board.While this is generally listed as 'gender neutral' I think buyers should know there is a *lot* of blue in this set.  While that doesn't matter to us, I know some parents prefer more yellows, greens, oranges, etc... for true gender neutrality.The embroidered details (Humpty Dumpty, Cow Jumping Over the Moon, etc..) on the quilt, bumper pad, diaper stacker and hamper are just beautiful.  they stand out but are do not take away from the prettiness of the fabric.The accessories are cute but I think if I had paid full price for the hamper & lamp that I would be less pleased.  The material of the hamper is great, but the wooden structure is very flimsy.  I foresee this getting put inside the closet once baby is crawling or it will easily be pulled over.The lamp has a story book with Hey Diddle Diddle (cow, spoon, dish) on it - very cute - but up close you notice it was not painted well.  From a slight distance you don't notice it, but it does bug me a little considering the price.The mobile is cute, but I do not care for the fact that the baby will only see the bottoms of the stars, moon and cow.  Not nearly as exciting as the ones that position the animals/shapes down towards the baby. Would not be my first choice for mobiles (I prefer the geometric symphony one), but since I got this as a package deal I will likely use it.Overall:  *the material is nice quality & touchably soft*the colors & embroidery are beautiful*the colors do lean a bit more towards a traditional 'boy' room versus a neutral room with light blue as the main color for the bumper pad, the dust ruffle, the hamper and the valance*hamper, lamp & mobile not as high quality products as the crib setI would recommend this crib set to friends & family sans hamper, lamp & mobile.  The nursery rhyme theme is classic & well put together here by Lambs & Ivy.I rated this 5 stars simply for the crib set.  For the price and the amount of items included it is a great deal.  If I were rating the accessories I would not give them more than a 3 for just being average",United States,MO

B00006966I,Playtex VentAire Newborn Gift Set: Baby,baby,1 of 1,4.0,Good bottle overall,"December 19, 2006",M. McQueen,Kentucky,"When I registered for my baby shower, I inadvertently registered for the regular Ventaire bottles as well as the Natural Shape bottles (which is what I was wanting), so my review will discuss both types.NATURAL SHAPE VENTAIREFor starters, the Natural Shape bottles are good for babies who are breastfeeding, because the milk doesn't flow out when the bottle is tipped over.  The baby really has to suck to get it out, and it has to open its mouth wider due to the size of the nipple.  Feeding my son with a stage 1 nipple took a REALLY long time.  Approximately 40-45 minutes.  However, I tried a Stage 2 nipple when he was about four months old, and the milk flowed out pretty easily.  So quickly in fact that he got really mad and refused to eat because he was getting choked.  I switched back to Stage 1 nipples, and also began relying heavily on the regular Ventaire bottles.  He is now 5 months old and we have switched to Stage 2 nipples in the Natural Shape bottles, and he is doing well.  He tends to finish a 6-7 oz bottle in about 10 minutes.  These bottles are a lot wider than regular bottles, and he has a harder time trying to grasp and hold these bottles.REGULAR VENTAIRE Now for the regular Ventaire bottles.  I found these bottles to be the better of the two for us.  Although I had initially breastfed, and chose the Natural Shape bottles for that reason, I had to quit breastfeeding at four weeks.  So the issue of having a nipple that wouldn't confuse the baby was no longer a concern for us.The regular Ventaire bottles had no flow issues, even with Stage 1 nipples.  He finished his bottle faster with this type of bottle and seemed to have no problems with the speed of the flow.  We switched to Stage 2 nipples a couple of weeks ago and the transition was smooth.  I didn't notice him getting choked, and he doesn't have to gulp as quickly as he does with the Stage 2 nipples on the Natural Shape bottles.  These bottles are also slimmer, which makes it easier for him to try and grasp and hold the bottle.Now for the operation of both types of bottles.  They have a plastic disc that fits into the bottom ring of the bottle, then the bottle screws on, and finally the nipple in its ring screw on top of that.  On the regular Ventaire bottles the disc fits snugly into the bottom.  On the Natural Shape bottles, it has to fit into a little notch, and it is easy to think it's in right only to find out that its not (ie, when the milk starts leaking out).We heat our bottles in a pan of water on the stove, and the bottom rings have a tendency to hold water.  So if you use this method, you need to tap the bottle sideways on the pan to shake out the water in the ring, and I usually hold a dish towel up to the edge of the ring as well and tip the bottle so that all the hot water comes out.  If you don't, when you tip the bottle to feed your baby the hot water will run down onto your hand (or the baby's hand if s/he can hold the bottle).  This isn't really a reason not to buy the bottles, just something to be aware of.Finally, some people have wondered if babies swallow less air with this type of bottle.  I have two older children that I used standard bottles with, and I have seen no difference between those and these Playtex bottles.  My son still burps just as much as the next baby.  Occasionally during feeding you can hear some air leaking out, but overall, I really don't think it makes any difference",United States,WV

I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs. It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around.

It's comfy, and the fact that the splash guard is a unibody construction with the removable pot is a godsend, in terms of how easy it is for my son to get on and off the chair. Within days of his first success, he was able to use this potty with no help and carry the pot in to me in the next room to show off his latest success! However, we didn't find out how truly great it was until we tried to buy a second potty for upstairs use. We've purchased two others. One had a splash guard so low and poorly designed that my son's ""privates"" landed squarely on top of it every time he sat down. Another had a high splash guard, but it was soft and movable and flopped down underneath my son every time he sat down. He's become very upset each time we try a new terrible potty and I feel awful for putting him through it. No more.

You should, however, remove the bumpers once your child is able to pull him or her self to a standing position in the crib, since the bumper can be used as a step to climb up and fall out.  I hope this puts some of your minds at ease.",United States,PA

I spent a good amount of time at the store looking/feeling the other car seats.  This model is very durable, good feel of the material, and it's going to last!!!

Knight ""new mom""","Atlanta, GA","I *LOVE* this product.  It's a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro.  In comparison to a blanket, this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles.  I'm quite good with a blanket, but by six weeks of age, my son could wriggle out.  On the other hand, at three months, he's never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme.However, even in cold weather, the microfleece is too hot.  Several times I've felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty.  It's even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling.  On the other hand, the cotton knit (solid colors) blankets are too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga, leaving both arms flying free.  The cotton flannel (gingham prints) has less stretch than the other two fabrics, and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures.  It is trickier to find, but worth the search.The microfleece Swaddleme does, however, make a great non-swaddle blanket on cold days, particularly when the baby is in a front carrier.

I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked great! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! 2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter!

Often I could comfort her before she really got good and awake/upset and I could get her back to sleep faster. At 6months, she was getting too large for it, so I transitioned her to her own crib in the nursery with no problem. The only drawback is that it is not very easy to fold up for travel-I had to get my husband to do it for me every time. BUT, I have yet to find a portable crib that is very easy to fold up (we have a Pack and Play too). When you do get it folded up and put into its carrying case, it doesn't take up that much room.

The peel-off backing is difficult to remove from the tape with out tearing the potty topper.  It takes a bit of time to get off, and if you have a toddler dancing around the bathroom stall, doing the pee-pee dance, you don't have the luxury of a lot of time.  Also, when the 'deed is done', and it's time to remove the potty seat cover, you again need to be very careful, or the tape will tear off the cover, and remain on the toilet seat.  Then you have to pick it off with your fingernail - YUCK!  I think a 'post-it note' kind of stick-in-place would be much better than the double sided tape.  The seat cover doesn't need to stick to the seat forever, just long enough for my toddler to tinkle.  Other than that, this is great.  After my toddler finished, I used it too, and found it to be very comfy.  It was cushiony, and provided a warm layer over a cold toilet seat.  I didn't have to worry about anything leaking through, as it seems to be water-proof.  It was large enough to cover the enitre seat, even those large public toilet seats.  I will continue to use these, as they do provide the layer of protection I am looking for, but I will need to be extra careful with the tape, until something better comes on the market",United States,PA

I put the liner (I use the cheaper soft bags) directly into the bottle.  Then I screw on the collar and pump adaptor.  I pump directly into the bottle then screw off the adaptor and screw on a lid (nipple ring with a plug in it).  Then when the baby sitter goes to feed the baby, she does not have to take off the collar and risk loosing the bag of milk.  She just screws off the top lid and screws on a nipple (using a contrasting color nipple ring with the plug for a lid may help distinguish which part should be unscrewed).  (This also solves that problem of having the milk raised above the readings on the bottle.)  Only thing I don't understand is why they don't give you more of the plugs that go in the lids.  You wouldn't need the lids if they would just give you the plugs, you could put them in the rings that go with your bottles....I know this is confusing; you kind of need to be looking at the pieces to understand what I'm talking about.

After showing it to one of my girlfriends, she replaced everything she used for baby #1 with Playtex and used the Playtex system for baby #2.It is a very clean and simple system and minimizes the risk of contamination since you do not have to transfer milk from one storage device to another.  It worked perfectly with my Medela Pump in Style; you use the same bag for pumping, storing and feeding.  I have a deep-freeze chest freezer and used this for storage.  I followed the manufacturer's suggestion to double bag for freezing.  I never had any problems.  If you want to see how much your baby is eating, with clean hands, simply lift the bag out of the ring and drop it directly into the bottle shell (the ring is heavy-duty enough that it lifts out easily).  Remember, when you are breastfeeding baby directly from the breast, you don't see how much baby is getting.  Dr. Sears says, ""A baby who is getting a sufficient volume of milk will usually have at least 6-8 wet cloth diapers (4-6 disposable diapers) per day after the initial three days of start-up time.  Enough wet diapers tell you that your baby is safe from dehydration.""  Everyone has different preferences, but I honestly can't see how anyone could be dissapointed with this storage kit.  I only purchased two kits because most of the time, I fed directly from the breast, and eventually, dd wouldn't take a bottle, but for moms who plan to return to work, I would recommend more kits.

Cup holders: we've already spilled juice that's been left in the cup holders.  They are completely useless and should have been better designed.Fabric: though the material looks resilient, a tear has developed near the lower left corner where her leg sits... I am assuming that this is because the chair is mounted behind the driver's seat, and therefore it gets a lot of traffic as our daughter boards and disembarks the car - nonetheless, we expected something a little more durable.Anchors: the seat wobbles around and doesn't really hold our daughter in place.

First we tried the Jupiter booster.  My daughter is a tiny girl (5yrs.old- 36 lbs. 43 inches tall).  She was way too tiny for the Jupiter.  The shoulder belt kept sliding off her shoulder and her head wasn't supported when she slept in the car. Another thing i didn't like about the Jupiter was that the padding under her bottom felt too thin and she complained her bottom hurt after long car rides.  Then we tried the Graco.  It is a good seat.  But no head support unless you lay the seat back a ways.  I didn't like the plastic seat belt guides because it hurt my daughter's cheek sleeping on it.  Next we tried the Parkway (Britax).  This booster is by far the best booster on the market in my opinion.  I am a huge Britax fan.  All my kids have been britax babies.  My 3 year old and 4 month old currently sit in the Marathon (britax).  This booster has enough padding to keep the kids comfortable, the head rests keep their heads from flopping.  My daughter likes the way the fabric feels (she is very sensitive).  Even though the Graco booster seat looks like the Parkway, and the Graco is $50 less than the Parkway, I still didn't like the fact that the red seat belt guides (on the Graco) looked like they would hurt to rest my head on.

B00005BLM6,Dr. Brown'S Starter Kit: Baby,baby,2 of 2,5.0,Get the 8oz bottles only.,"January 3, 2006",F. Khan,"Windsor, Ontario.","I initially tried the Avent wide-neck bottles for my newborn and didn't like them. Those bottles leaked, the nipples gave my son suction blisters on his lips, he needed extensive burping, I didn't find the graduations on the bottles to correlate with any other measures at home and my son seemed to have a hard time getting a hang of how to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in the Avent bottles. Dr Browns bottles solved all these issues. I am extremely happy with them.You need to get used to washing the small parts but once you have a routine going it's well worth the effort. It takes me under 20 minutes to wash six bottles (I prefer not to use the dishwasher). The small brush which comes in the starter kit and the multi-pack varieties is essential for cleaning and lasts for about 6-8 weeks of regular use. I recommend going straight for the 8oz bottles and buy the 9-pack which is available at other websites. When warming these bottles, if you find the fluid going up into the vent, just loosen the collar, the column of liquid goes back down and tighten again. If breastmilk is stored in these bottles in the fridge, the fat content does tend to stick to the plastic of the vent. You will receive Level-1 nipples with the starter kit/multi-packs, however you may want to graduate to Level-2 at 3-months of age, Level-2 at 6-months of age and the Y-cut nipples for any thick liquids (e.g milk with cereal).  The caps snap on loudly which is the only 'con' I can think of. Use the travel disc to avoid leakage when transporting milk.My friend's babies with refulx did well on these bottles. My son doesn't have reflux but I can't imagine using any other bottle for him. Highly recommend them and would definitely buy agai",Canada,ON

The hospital bottles either fed too fast or required too much sucking for him.  Once we got him home we bought every bottle we could find to try.  Dr. Brown's was the third one we tried and it worked fantastic for him.  The nipples fed him slow but did not require too much effort for him.  Once we started him on this bottle, he started eating exactly as he should and has not had a problem since.  We also had to use Nutramigen formula which also helped with gas and reflux, but for us it was the nipple and the ease of use for him.  The downside for us was that they don't fit well in our dishwasher so we hand wash all of them.  When we go out we put dry formula in each bottle and carry bottled water with us.  When we need to mix a bottle we take out the inside pieces, put the cap on and screw the neck and nipple back on, shake it well and replace the inside and we have no problem with shaking - just take out the inside piece.

HELPFUL HINT for all Dr. Brown bottles: When pulling nipple thru the collar, everytime run your finger around the base of the nipple inside the plastic collar to make sure it is fully seated before screwing nipple and collar on to the bottle. Eliminates leaks completely. And do NOT over-tighten collar onto bottle. Again, will prevent leaks. We learned all of these tricks the hard way! :)Mother of twin girls from Texa",United States,TX

I have used it since the day I brought my son home from the hospital. It helps a baby to develop focus and tracking skills and increases alertness in the first couple months. It then helps with hand eye coordination. You can dangle an assortment of toys from the arches. We never purchased any of the extra ones you can get because I'd just add some of his other toys with the clip-ons you'd use with a stroller. It is hard to find an educational toy for a newborn that can be interactive as well and last! This fits the bill. You can lie on the floor and talk to them about what they are looking at..sometimes my baby is just happy to have his playtime and can play independantly for about 20-30 minutes. It is portable. We have folded it up and taken it in a suitcase with us 5 times now! Because it is so lightweight and folds up easily it is great for travelling. Then you can set it up in your hotel room or at grandma's house and baby is in a familiar environment to play in which gives you some hands free time and baby some fun as well. It has amazed me how much older children play with it to! Thanksgiving and Christmas at Grandma's all the nieces/nephews from ages 4 to 14 were playing with it on their own and with the baby. Now at 4 months I think my son gets a little bored with it because he likes to be sitting up. Yet he will still play with it for a good 15 minutes ( it may not seem like much but trust me on this, if you want to enjoy a nice cup of coffee/tea in the morning while it is still hot this is a good thing!). I tend to rotate his toys now so I think this will still bring entertainment for up to a year. Toddlers we have had over like to crawl under the arches and past the dangling toys..",Canada,AB

I plan to keep my daughter on breastmilk until she's at least one and wanted a pump that would last.  I tried one of the Avent manual pumps, but I had to be engorged before I would get a few ounces out of one side (nothing out of the other).

I bought extra shields and bottles to pack with me to take to work, and keep the rest at home.  The only downside I saw to these bottles is that they are made to fit only with Medela products.

Since my son was premature I had to pump exclusively in the beginning, and I can say without reservation that this pump works just as well, and quickly, as the hospital pump.  It empties my breasts in 10 minutes, it's easy, and it travels well.  Also with certain bras (not the Medela bras, as they seem to require some type of adapter) you can pump hands free by simply hooking/securing the nursing bra cups over the breast pump cups.One last comment I will make which speaks to quality, is that I ordered extra membranes and tubing to have available ""just in case,""  but have yet to need them as the original ones are still operational.I can - and DO - recommend this pump to all nursing moms, and if you think this one is expensive, consider two things:  1. the value of your time and convenience, and 2. the total cost after you end up replacing the cheaper one when you find that it doesn't really meet your expectations or breaks down",United States,AK

I have now mastered how to put the formula in and how long to shake it but it took some practice to get it right without the formula clumping a lot. Warming the bottles is also a problem since you cannot microwave the liners (or so it says) my mother did it once without realizing you aren't supposed to and nothing bad happened but since it advises against it, I wouldn't recommended trying it out. Now that my son doesn't really care for warm milk it isn't an issue anymore anyway.

We are doing ""elimination communication"" with him & this potty works well for his first potty.  Currently (he is almost 4 mo.old) we set the potty on the changing table & hold him.  For safety reasons, we never let go of him while sitting there.  When he can sit up on his own, we will sit the potty on the floor.  Eventually he will out grow it.  We also purchased the BabyBjorn Potty Trainer, eventually he'll use that next. In the meantime the next older child is able to use it.  I like that this potty is all in 1 piece.  So easy to clean (no crevises to worry about).  We dump the contents into the toilet.  Add a little water, to the potty, from the sink (the potty easily fits into our bathroom sink to catch the rinse water) & dump rinse water into toilet.  The size is nice for storing...it won't take up a lot of room.  The size is nice because (eventually when he is older) he'll be able to get on & off it easily himself.I would have prefered this item in white instead of blue...but at the time of ordering the color blue was the best option  (After an additional item was purchased with my order, I was also able to qualify for free shipping through Amazon).  The colors available would not be the fault of the manufacturer but who I purchased it from.I was unable to find this at any of the stores in my local area.  We would have had to drive 50 minutes or more away from our home to purchase it at a certain baby store.  Then we would have also paid sales tax & our costs to drive there.

B000HHYJLW,"Compass Premier Folding, Adjustable Booster: Baby",baby,1 of 2,4.0,Pleased,"February 19, 2007","A. H. Coleman ""TripletheFun""",Texas,"I think that overall this booster is great.  It is lightweight and large enough to accommodate children as they grow.  My 3 year old son (about 30lbs) looks kind of tiny inside of the seat and he can slouch in the seat, but the seatbelt position is at a good height on small children.  This seat would do well for a child who easily goes and remains in the seat...but not for a child who likes to climb out of their seat",United States,MI
B000HHYJLW,"Compass Premier Folding, Adjustable Booster: Baby",baby,8 of 12,5.0,"Nice, lightweight, safe, durable, and fully featured.","November 9, 2006","Handy Man88 ""Handy Man""",East Coast,"I bought this booster seat after considering other seats from Cosco and Britax.  This one stood out for value, simplicity, safety, and convenience.  At first, I considerd a convertible booster seat that also has the latch system along with 5 point seatbelts, but decided against it because my son at his age and weight (3.3 yrs, 35 lbs) does not need all these extra features in an extra bulky be-all car seat.  The latch and 5 point features are intended more for a recent 3 year old, while a toddler from 3.5 years to 10 won't need it, so why bother with all this extra stuff?  You don't need the added bulk and complexity for features that will only be used for .5 more years.  The B510 premier is the top of the line and latest from Compass, which has more durable fabric, wider side supports, and a carry bag.  My son loved it at first sight, and it works great.  There is no neck support though, so you may need to buy one of these separately for long road trips.  My son was literally propping his head up with his arm on the arm rest when he passed out in the car.  The price of the B510 was $[...] with free shipping, and given the free carry bag which has a retail value of $[...], it makes this booster seat about $[...], which is the price of the older B500 model.The only thing I have had to get over is that booster seats in general are not secured onto the car seat with a latch, but instead, rely on the seat belt to keep my son and the seat in place.  When driving around without the kids, seats like this need to be secured even if a child is not sitting in it.  The base of this seat doesn't look like it'll rip into my car's leather seat, and the headrest adjusts vertically easily.  I will need to buy a seat protector anyway though, since my son uses the car's seat as a step stool to get into this booster seat.  Also, you will need to train your kids when they can unbuckle the seat belt because it's easily reachable.The only shocking thing to me was that this seat comes with an expiration date, and is not recommended for use after 7 years from date of manufacture.  Therefore, it's not meant to be kept forever and used as a hand me down for siblings",Australia,Tasmania

My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms.While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe. I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow.I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one.Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby. We've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally. We've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face. So after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks from day one",United States,IL

Moss,"SLC, Utah","VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: DOT NOT TURN ON SYSTEM BEFORE READING THIS. You have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage, then Charge the system for 16 hours. DO NOT TURN SYSTEM ON WHILE CHARGING FOR THIS FIRST TIME!!! I did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents' websites. With most items, there are pros and cons... see below:Pros:-You will not pick-up any feedback from the neighbors. This is a significant improvement from monitors in the past. ABSOLUTLY NO INTERFERENCE! -Great reception. You will have no problems picking up your child with this. I can take it outside and work in the yard, with confidence that I will know when my baby needs me.-Interchangeable AC power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house. -Lightweight and compact system. Cons:-The biggest issue is battery life. HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE, TYPICALLY ONLY 3-4 HOURS at a time! The battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband's opinion. This system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations, I HIGHLY RECOMMED the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock. Or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock.     -With any power interruption the child's unit shuts off. The parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue, but it can be irritating at 2:00 A.M. to have to get up to turn it back on. Graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in. -Belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement. The system is better left unattached to belt, unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground.-A bit expensive.A little of both... Pros/Cons: -Sound: Pro: Great sound, very clear. In fact I can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor.  Con: Picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive. For the light sleepers, on the softest level still can be very loud. -Loud, every 5 seconds, parents warning: Pro: Beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system. This was nice for us one day when the baby's system had fallen and came unplugged. If the system had not beeped, we would not have known. Con: Annoying beeping while searching for signal... a startling fact in the middle of the night. *Overall the system does what it should, but there a few area's that could be improved. I gave it 3 1/2 stars but rounded it up.*",United States,UT

Thank goodness we had the opportunity to try one out before we bought it!   With the Joovy, if you have an infant carrier in the front seat, there is no room at all for the older child to sit on the jump seat.  Also, for some strange reason, the jump seat slides back and forth which seems very unsafe.  So if you have an infant in a carrier and your older child wants to sit, the older child is out of luck.  What's the point of that?With this stroller, the older child has 3 options - sit in the back seat, sit on the jump seat or stand on the platform.  The back seat can be removed fairly easily and stored in the basket underneath and my little girl (who is tall for her age) has plenty of room.  She sometimes dangles her feet over the foot rest but this is not an issue.  Our infant carrier easily slides into the front seat and is secured with a belt. This stroller opens and closes easily and is very easy to control as it steers beautifully - it's not nearly as long as I thought it would be but both children have plenty of room. Since it has the footprint of a single stroller, it fits through doors and entranceways with no problem. It is a little heavy when folded but I don't think I would find a stroller with these features that's not.  The basket is nearly impossible to get to but I can live with it.  Overall, I'm thrilled with this purchase and every single time I use it, someone stops me to ask about it.  One woman even said, ""That's the most practical double stroller I've ever seen.""

The problem is most cribs now (such as mine) have solid ends, and you can't tie anything to them. This toy is meant to be used at the end of a crib, and it simply won't fit.

It was a bit tricky getting it installed in the car (I recommend reading the instructions, and having an extra set of hands to help you install it) but all carseats can be a bit tricky.  My 7 month old son loves this carseat because it sits higher up than his first seat and he can see outside (this makes our road trips MUCH more pleasant).  There are lots of places for you to adjust the straps, buckle, and headrest so you can really make the seat fit your baby.  I am not sure how well it would work for a newborn because it doesn't recline as far as carseats that are only rear-facing, and it might make it harder for your little one to take naps and keep his head in a comfortable position. (Plus, it is SO nice to have a carseat with a detachable base for a brand new baby so you don't have to wake them up when they are sleeping).  But if you only want one carseat, I am sure a neck support pillow in the carseat would work great for newborns.My favorite feature of this carseat is that I won't have to keep buying more carseats (and then find a place to store the old ones) until my son is old enough to ride without one",United States,ID

I bought them on a whim and boy was a glad. They help get my milk started because they apply a light pressure which also helps extent the nipple. They keep things (such as a bra) from rubbing against very very sore nipples. Another great feature is the air vents at the top of the cups. They are there to get air to nipple, (you don't want them getting dried out, that just makes the pain of feeding much worse). Determined breastfeeding mom's these are fantastic until your milk supply comes in at a steady pace.They do not look flattering under a TIGHT fitting shirt (loose is always best anyways) but what does when you are breastfeeding for the first few months as things are adjusting.

It helped relieve soreness while breast is in bra. It keeps the sore nipple suspended in midair and off of rubbing on your bra.  It also helps the nipple stick out a little, which I found made attachment (of baby's mouth to nipple)easier as a first time breast-feeder.  You do need to check the shield now and then to dump out any milk (or some may save it). The only way I see a product could improve in that area, would be to have a bottle size attachment to your boob and whom of us would really want to walk around with that?   There are holes in the top of the shield to allow air circulation. For me esp. at night I would put a nursing pad over the holes so that it would help soak up any leakage. But by FAR this product is worth it.  I'm due soon with baby #2 and am back to buy more. I gave mine to a mom friend who was ready to give up breastfeeding her very hungry son who ate all the time and her breasts were unbearably sore.

The good news is if you use breast shells when you need them for the above mentioned maladies- you won't have to use them for long because you will heal after just a few days even if you wear them part time. They come with little curved white sponges that you just drop in the bottom of the shell.  These sponges absorb the milk that leaks so that you don't have to worry about it comming out of the vent holes at the top when you bend over. I just would rinse them with soap and water to clean and let air dry I think each breast shell set come with four sponges and you can buy more if you need them but 4 was enough for me.

Our street is full of parents with babies and on Sundays the street looks like a stroller racing track. That was great for me and my wife. We were able to see and test many strollers as they all seem to be on our street and in the area. I was lucky to push some other brands that are more expensive and I must say this stroller just felt better then the other strollers we tested. This stroller is fully loaded with all the features a parent and child could ask for. I especially like the individual lower recline feature. The stroller rolls with such ease and the rain cover being included is a great idea as they cost around [...] which takes the base price up on many other strollers. Our little guy's both a year old now (they are twins) have a great time in this stroller and seem to be very comfortable. I was thinking of purchasing a model with front swivel wheels but I just did not like the way the swivel wheel felt. I tested three different brands. The one I liked sold for more then [...] and compared to this stroller I just could not justify spending that kind of money. The other two front swivel wheeled strollers that I tested had a rattle feel to the front wheel area which I was so surprised about considering they both sold for more then [...]. I am not sure if that was because they were 12 inch wheels or if it was the designs.

B000GB0O0O,Munchkin iCrib Sound System: Baby,baby,2 of 2,5.0,iLove the iCrib!,"January 18, 2007",E.T.,"Fremont, CA United States","After throwing my First Years crib CD player literally in the trash can (don't get me started on what a complete hunk of junk that thing was), I was on a search to replace it. That is when I came across the iCrib. You really can't beat the price - I'm guessing it is reasonable since most of the controlling is done from the iPod itself. Granted I have only had it a few days, I cannot rave enough about it! It mounted perfectly on the crib and I think the sound is fantastic (I have only tried classical and not music with lyrics so I cannot comment on that sound quality). I inherited my husband's older iPod Shuffle after I gave him a Nano for X-mas. I searched and searched online but could not figure out whether the iPod Shuffle would work with it. Muchkin's customer service verified that it would because it came with a few adapters to accomodate different MP3 players. Now, I don't really think they made one to specifically fit the Shuffle, but it did fit well enough in the ""small"" adapter they included so I was happy (see the picture I posted of the Shuffle in the iCrib). The iCrib itself has 3 modes - light only (iPod is off), light and iPod, or just iPod. You can also have it play for 15, 30 or 60 minutes before it shuts itself off. The light is actually what I would consider a ""light show"" with the light slowly changing colors which I think is rather calming as does my baby (or at least it seems). The only things I would change about the iCrib is that I would really like it to have the option of playing longer than 60 min. I would also be happier if it had the option of providing a steady, soft light to serve as a constant night light (no ""light show"") to guide me during the middle of the night feedings. Otherwise, I am thrilled with the iCrib",United States,CA

What we like about it:- The Moby wrap was able to be used the day we brought our preemie baby home from the hospital. - The Moby wrap swaddles your baby snuggly to you.  If your baby likes swaddling as much as our does, this is the baby carrier for you.- It spreads the weight out evenly across your back and shoulders and feels much better for longer periods of time (in comparison to our Baby Bjorn).   - There are a variety of ways to wear your baby with this carrier.  We have used it 4 different ways so far.  Being able to pull the cloth completely over her so she can sleep soundly is a plus.  The instructions are easy to follow and while it looks difficult to put on, it really is quite simple after you've practiced it 3 or 4 times.- The Moby wrap is easy to clean with being machine washable and dryable and there are no parts that can be broken or lost.What we don't like about the Moby wrap:- If you plan on wearing your baby to go grocery shopping or other things out in public, you need to put it on before you leave the house.  It can be difficult to put on in the car or in places where you do not feel comfortable with the wrap touching the floor (parking lot, public floor, etc.).  This is not a big deal, but important to remember before you run out the door.  During the cooler months, I put the Moby on, then my coat.Bottom-line:  The Moby wrap was an excellent purchase.  Putting our daughter in it and walking around or bouncing on an exercise ball was one of the few ways to calm her during the height of her colic.  Our daughter is now 5-months old and still enjoys the Moby.  We expect to continue to use our Moby wrap for many more months",United States,WA

The basket is large and fits a lot of stuff. Walking in the city with my 2-year-old and newborn is pretty easy with this stroller.The only major downside of this stroller is that it doesn't hold a car seat. ",United States,IL

Holahan ""Bahama Mama""","Boston, MA United States","I received the Combi Ex Travel System for my baby shower. It looked like the perfect size/ weight for city living. Unfortunately it did not work out that way. The stroller began squeaking and falling apart from all of the bumping around on brick and cobblestone through the city. The basket is also very very tiny and is inhibited by a large bar through the middle. I would reccommend this stroller for use on smooth surfaces. The carseat is great and easy to use, but the stroller was not what I expected. One tip for the urban parent-- sink your $$ into a good stroller with shocks. It's worth it",United States,MA

I didnt find it difficult at all since everything just snaps into place. I gave this 4 stars because I find it a little difficult to attach the carseat to the stroller. I find myself having to try quite a few times before it snaps into place. The other thing is that closing the stroller needs some practice before you can get it right. Other than those two issues, the stroller system is very classy and different from others out there.

When we saw the quattro duo we couldn't wait for it to come out. We waited for it to hit the shelves which did not happen around here yet. So we nervously ordered it online without a test drive. Our nerves were settled when we recieved it the other day. Yes it is heavy, but I manage fine. It is longer than the picture but if it was any shorter you could not fit 2 children in it. This stroller has too many nice features to dwell on the small negatives. The best part besides the easy fold down is that it fits easily with room into my car (I have a Mazda 6).

I had researched them all and was going to buy it sight unseen, which made me nervous.  Went to a local retailer yesterday and after an instore test drive with my almost 3yr old and my 3 month old bought it immediately.  I can't say enough great things about this stroller.  Especially as a mom of toddler and infant.  It handles like a dream all the bells and whistles are fabulous.  Folds like a piece of cake.  Which I can't say about my perego.  The basket drops down so you can access it without changing the rear seat position.  My 3yr old thinks it is the coolest thing ever and she loves the fact that her baby sister is right behind her.  Yes it is a little heavy, but I am a small woman and can manage just fine.  After all my oldest weighs 28lbs.  It is a little longer in person than in the photos - (no big deal)  We all went for our first family stroll after dinner last night it was amazing.  Handles fantastically over bumpy sidewalks - no need to prop up the srtoller to get over a bump.  So STURDY - feel like both my girls are snug and safe.  Love that the five point harness is attached to the seat, unlike the perego.  Really if you have to children (particularly a baby and toddler) this is the way to go!!",United States,NJ

I called Graco this morning and they are sending me a new one for free, no questions asked. The stroller is a bit longer than it is portrayed in the picture, but it is still smaller than the Duo Glider, and it handles wonderfully. It is definately something I would not mind taking to the mall! I love how the rear basket can be dropped down, not being able to access it with the baby seat in was a peave of mine with my quattro tour single.

I also considered the Combi, Aria twin, and Maclaren.  I test drove the side by side strollers but they couldn't fit through tight store aisles. I liked the Combi and the Aria's width but they were awkward to steer and I didn't care for the storage in any of them.  I agree with the above comments but the pros outweight the cons. It is heavy and it doesn't fold down as compactly as I would like but my son absolutely loves climbing in the front seat.  I am 5'2"" and I liked the handles and found it very easy to steer.

Turner ""goodyearchic""","Buckeye,AZ","I owned the Quattro Tour single stroller, and was so excited when the Duo version came out.  I ordered it without ever seeing it, and it has definitely lived up to my high expectations.  Simply stated, this is a heavy duty deluxe version of a Duo Glider - worth the extra money if you can afford it.The seats are large enough for growing children - I have a one yr old and a two yr old, and I foresee they will both fit in the stroller for a couple of years.  I ""test drove"" all other double strollers at Babies R Us and Baby Depot, and they all seem to have low seat backs, which won't give any head support if the child falls asleep.The stroller itself is heavy, so if you have to lug it around or upstairs, keep this in mind.  I keep mine in the back of my truck, so just getting it in and out is no big deal.I read other reports stating it is hard to steer, and I have had no problems with steering at all.  One thing I can say, is if you are a tall person, this stroller is awesome because of it's higher handle grips.  I am 5'9"", and my husband is 6'4"" and we both use it with ease.The underseat basket is large, and there is an additional ""cubby"" under the front seat great for extra storage.  Parent cupholders and child trays/cups are designed well.  Fabric is high quality.The only minor thing I am annoyed with is the low quality seat restraints (""Seat belts"").  My single Quattro Tour and DuoGlider both had high quality padded seat belts with much better buckles.  This one has very low quality nylon straps and marginally acceptable buckles.  (I also received my box in very poor shape - open & crushed on one side. I only noticed scratches to the stroller, so didn't feel it was worth going through a return process for cosmetic issues.  What is up with the shipping???) ***ULTIMATELY*** After hours of ""test drives"" and quite a bit of research, I would recommend this over all other equal and higher dollar strollers.  It is overall very high quality, and for those worried about style, it is a very sharp looking stroller in person",United States,AZ

B000056HM5,Playtex Original Nurser Newborn Gift Set: Baby,baby,3 of 3,4.0,"Good bottles, few problems!","August 2, 2006",YHWH4ever,"Palmdale, CA","My strictly bottle fed 11 month old has used these bottles from day one and has done fine with them. I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used. I ended up switching out the older nipple design (square top) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better. It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling. I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them.I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle. Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins don't hold a full 8 ozs. and they are correct. To solve this problem, I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don't buy the Playtex brand. I buy the Parent's Choice (PC) brand at Walmart. Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren't always correct. I bought the Target brand 4 oz. liners and realized (after several bottles) that the 4 oz. mark on the liner was only 3 ozs. The PC liners are correct!All-in-all, I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners. I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child. I'm really liking what I'm reading about the Dr. Brown's, but will possibly try a couple other brands as well. I'm realizing that saving tons of money isn't always what's best for my daughter.

I have used them with all 3 of my children with great success and my oldest is almost 15.  Gas was never a problem and my babies hardly ever spit up.  Everyone always commented on how nice my babies always smelled because they never had that sour smell that babies that spit up so much do.  I worked in numerous daycare centers and any time a parent had problems with a gassy baby that spit up all the time I always recommend Platex Nursers to them.  9 x's out of 10 their problems were drastically reduced thanks to Playtex.  I am now pregnant with my 4th baby and though I plan to breastfeed as much as I can if I need a back up bottle or nursing doesn't work for some reason then Playtex will be my bottle of choice.  Of all the new bottles out there on the market Playtex will still be my number 1 bottle of choice.  If there would be any drawback at all it would be the cost of the liners.  But I often got lucky and would find some at yardsales or on sale and would stock up.  Also some store brands carry liners just as good.  I had a few plastic bottles around just in case of running out but my babies didn't like them nearly as much and I could always tell a difference in their happiness because they would get gassy again.

The instructions don't give you clear enough directions and I ended up putting the latching piece on upside down the first time. The pictures were pretty useless, but once you figure out the right way to install it goes in in a snap. To make it more stable you can keep the gate locked to swing only one direction which makes it extra stable against kids puching on it. We had to move our once our kitchen remodel was done and it came down simple and went up in a new door way really easy. The latch itself on ours has to be pushed down as it will not latch into place by itself now but it is a very solid gate. And for being over 2 years old it has held up great. The latch handle can't be opened by anyone with small hands as you have to squeeze both sides so anyone with kids under 2-3 who can open it have installed it wrong.

This was a great find!  My son is almost 5 months old now, and he doesn't want to leave this bassinet (but it is definitely time, he is big for his age and is really outgrowing it).Things I am happy about:* I am able to see him without having to hardly lift my head at all, and can pick him up without having to strain or get out of bed... WONDERFUL!* This is the mini co-sleeper, and is small and unobtrusive.  Fits nicely next to my side of our bed, with not a whole lot of extra room in that space.  Easy to tote around when traveling as well, once broken down is quite compact.* Folds up very easily, similar to a pack-n-play but even easier I think, once you know how to do it (take the mattress out, press the buttons on the rails and fold).* Has a great little place to store extra blankets, the instructions, the carrying case, etc, below, in a zipped-up compartment.Things to note:* The mattress is a bit hard (basically like a pack-n-play mattress, a board topped with some padding and a polyester or whatever material cover), so I top it with the sheet it came with, along with a blanket that I tuck tightly under the sides.* The mattress does not sit flush with the side rails.  The lowered side rail sits at the same level as your bed, and the baby mattress is a bit lower than that... so the bassinet is not exactly an extension of your bed, you cannot just reach across and scoot baby to you (I thought it would be like that, but it isn't)... but actually I like this a bit better after all.* They sell leg extensions that raise the bassinet to the height of your bed if need be.  We needed the extensions, and after putting them on the lower side rail was at the same level as our bed.  The extensions made the bassinet a bit wobbly, which worried me some, but turns out it is just fine, even with my 2-year-old bouncing around in it!* Our little one did end up with his head against the side on a few occasions, but like someone else wrote, the one side is mesh, and he was just fine.  You kind of have to make sure the mattress lies level in its spot, kind of hard to explain without a visual aid, but basically the board in the mattress creates the level surface, underneath it is just a mesh screen that has Velcro to connect the sheet (which also has Velcro) in the right place.Hopes this helps in your decision-making!",United States,WA

It was very stiff & always became my husband's job. He  didn't like to do it either, by the way.Otherwise it was great to have & I was able to use it until my daughter was 8 months old (by then she could crawl out so it was not safe to use). It was nice to have her close for the middle of the night breastfeedings. And since we only have a queen bed, it was good to be able to put her into it after a feeding so my husband & I could have more room in the bed. Finally, for the middle of the night diaper changes or clothes changes (my daughter was a HUGE spitter upper) it was wonderful to have everything right there where I needed it. It was like a second changing table. I used it as a changing table while I was sitting on the bed. If I was standing, it was uncomfortably low. I had to bend down too much.

Knight ""new mom""","Atlanta, GA","I *LOVE* this product.  It's a far better velcro swaddler than the other brands because it uses bigger patches of velcro.  In comparison to a blanket, this is much easier to use and provides much more durable swaddles.  I'm quite good with a blanket, but by six weeks of age, my son could wriggle out.  On the other hand, at three months, he's never wriggled out of the cotton flannel Swaddleme.However, even in cold weather, the microfleece is too hot.  Several times I've felt under the blanket to find my son sweaty.  It's even worse when we combine the swaddle with a sling.  On the other hand, the cotton knit (solid colors) blankets are too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit Swaddleme into a toga, leaving both arms flying free.  The cotton flannel (gingham prints) has less stretch than the other two fabrics, and plenty enough cover to keep a baby warm at indoor temperatures.  It is trickier to find, but worth the search.The microfleece Swaddleme does, however, make a great non-swaddle blanket on cold days, particularly when the baby is in a front carrier.

B00016BPA2,Pump In Style Advanced Breastpump: Baby,baby,6 of 6,4.0,Handsfree pumping,"February 14, 2007","Sophia Lin ""sopapia""","irvine, ca United States","I've used all sorts of medela pumps, hospital grade Lactina, Symphony, and the PIS advanced is just as good if not better.  I didn't like the Symphony at all b/c the diaphragm that goes on the machine has to be really tight or it won't have good suction (which is most of the time).  I'm on my third PIS advanced.  With my first child, I had the PIS advanced backpack, first generation, and pumped for a year.  The amount of milk was adequate (had enough frozen away for extra month after I stopped).  I just didn't like the faceplate (I broke 3, where you attach the tubing to the faceplate), and the storage space for the backpack is very limited.  Then I bought the PIS advanced shoulder bag with my second child.  The storage area is better but the faceplate is still the same.  Then the PIS advanced limited edition came out.  I saw it and fell in love with it.  So I had to get it.  It's the nicest one thus far and long overdue.  The motor sits in a separate bag and the tubing can fit in the side pocket.  There is no danger of breaking the faceplate. I can just carry that to and from work.  I have two sets of parts, one for home and one at work). The bag has lots of storage space and best of all, it's chic.  They have blue, chocolate and black.  It also doubles as a diaper bag for me.As for hands free pumping:  the only reason I was able to pump for a year fist time and now 11mo and still going is b/c of the hands free pumping kit.  You have to get the Medela softcup bras (they're comfy anyway) that supports handsfree pumping.  There are 2 tabs inside on the bottom and one latch on the top.  You don't need to buy the whole hands free pumping kit; you just need the loop and hook attachment (part #3007073).  That hooks onto the top of the bra where there is a latch.  Then you tie a rubber band (thicker kind from any office supply store) around the tabs (3 of them, two sewn in the bra and one from the loop and hook attachment).  Then you put the breastshield with connector with bottles attached on your breast.  Then you loop the rubber band separately around the connector (the part where you're suppose to attach the tubing).  Connect the tubing, Viola, it should stay there snugly.  You don't have to hold them anymore.  You can also use this method with the softfit breastshield.  If you have larger breasts, use bigger rubberbands or link two together.  Now you can massage to get more milk, eat lunch, type on the computer, whatever (just can't lie down).  You can buy adapter for avent system and pump directly into their bottles, or other brands.  And there is no need to pump every 3-4h after your milk supply is established... that's insane. In the first few weeks it may be necessary to establish supply. I pumped 4 times a day and was able to get min 30oz a day (I was bottle feeding breastmilk exclusively), then slowly decreased to 3, to 2 to 1 as my baby got older.  The key is to pump all the milk out (with massaging and squeezing your breast) and then let it run 1-2min longer.  Also, use the maximum suction you can tolerate (this will increase and plateau as you pump).  If you want to decrease supply, just pump shorter and longer period of time lapse in between pumping.  If you want to increase, pump longer and more frequently as well as drink more water/eat more.  I could increase and decrease my supply at will, even without breastfeeding.  I pumped directly into 9 oz or 11 oz avent bottles using the avent adapter (avail at Babiesrus).  There are other systems out there.  I used the lansinoh milk storage bags to store my milk.  I store about 10-12oz (max 12oz) in each bag, squeeze all the air out, and deep freeze it for 6mo.  I know lansinoh suggest less than that, but it can be done as long as you get all the air out.  The trick is to use the side of a table, push the milk up to the ziplock and squeeze close the ziplock as the air is pushed out.  Since there are two zippers, a little milk can leak out of the first zipper to help get all the air out.  The bag will expand in the freezer just fine.  Once it's frozen, just don't nick the bag (b/c it's easy to damage it) and it will stay fine for 6mo in a deep freezer.  Even if you do damage the bag, it's ok.  it's just a pain when you thaw it. When you thaw the milk, you might see a little precipitate, but baby likes the milk just like it was fresh.Happy pumping",United States,CA
B00016BPA2,Pump In Style Advanced Breastpump: Baby,baby,2 of 4,4.0,Pretty good but I was hoping for better for the price,"January 9, 2007","Fargo Chowder ""Wes's wife""","Atlanta, Ga","I like the convenience of being able to carry this pump with me and I like that it comes with pump/freeze/serve bottles in a separate carrying case with a cooler block. Plus, the bag is good-looking and you wouldn't even know it's a breast pump. And the pump itself works well.What I was not thrilled about is that the bottles didn't come with nipples and the Medela nipples are not easy to find on their own. I had to buy a separate pump and store starter kit (4 bottles, caps, nipples) to get a decent supply. Also, the pump is a little louder than I thought it would be but if you zip the pump's compartment while you're pumping, it does cut down on the noise. Another thing is that I expected there to be different speeds of pumping like there was in the Ameda hospital pump I rented for a couple of weeks but even at $319, it has only one speed (although you can adjust the vacuum strength). Last, and this isn't directed specifically at this pump but at all pumps that can pump both breasts simultaneously... I don't think they're worth it. I don't really even pump both breasts at the same time anymore because it's not easy to sit there holding both cups over both breasts on top of adjusting the dials and possibly holding or trying to soothe a baby. I constantly broke the suction seals and dripped milk on my lap. And I spent so much time readjusting the cups and trying to get comfortable that I could have just pumped one breast at a time (which I do now). Fortunately, the Medela pump works pretty fast magic on me.",United States,GA

Neville ""2monstersmommy""","Walnut Creek, CA USA","I have such a difficult time breastfeeding that it is near impossible for me to do it without crying. After seeing tons of lactation consultants I finally decided to pump all of my sons feedings. I was given a slightly older model of the Pump in Style Original and was not very comfortable. So I rented the Medela Symphony for a month ($90 + starter kit). That pump was amazing but at 90 a month not so practical. So I bought the PiS Advance. Although it's not as efficient as the hospital grade Symphony this pump does an amazing job. It's much quiter than the original and has the 2 phase suction. Not only is the 2 phase suction more efficient, I have found that the initial short suck phase preps my body for the more intense longer pulls that follow. For most I'm sure the original is fantastic but if you're very sensitive the Pump in Style Advance is what you need (unless you want to shell out $90 a month. The Symphony retails at around $1250.00.

It worked as advertised in all the jumbo jets, and elicited generally positive reactions from other passengers and flight crew; however it could not pass through the aisles of an Embraer commuter plane that we had to take on a short leg of our journey. In order to secure it correctly on the airline seat, you may have to get a seatbelt extender from the flight attendant.Having this car seat/stroller is great if you are travelling with small kids; they sleep comfortably in it and makes for more efficient transfer between gates. I share the observation that others made regarding its inability to take bumps... for that reason it is not a good choice beyond travel and maybe use within a shopping mall.

When my girl falls asleep her head is usually hanging forward because of the forward slant.The seatbelt has to go over the top of the seat, so you have to reattach everything every time you put your baby into it and that can get a little annoying.The stroller part is great though.

B000E9TD2I,BOB Revolution 2006 Stroller Navy: Baby,baby,18 of 18,4.0,Great go-everywhere stroller,"August 4, 2006",Garbonzo,"Baltimore, MD USA","Several months of research combined with real-world experience pushing my nieces and nephews in different strollers brought us around to the Bob Revolution.We wanted a stroller that could handle rough/uneven sidewalks, cobblestone streets, and off-road trails.  We also wanted to use the same stroller at the mall, grocery store, and small shops.  We have a compact, lightweight stroller for travel, so we focused on three-wheelers with air-filled tires, a rotating front wheel (a must-have feature for 3-wheelers!), and a canopy with excellent coverage.  We looked at strollers from Mountain Buggy, Valco, Baby Jogger, Phil & Ted, Dreamer Designs, etc. (we were willing to spend a good amount on a quality stroller, but we were not about to go for a Bugaboo).We decided on the Bob Revolution and we have been very happy with it.PROS1. It is very easy to push over all kinds of surfaces and up hill as well as to steer with one hand.2. The canopy is by far the best we've seen on any kind of stroller.3. The front wheel swivels 360 degrees and can lock.4. It folds/unfolds easily.5. The seat is roomy and seems reasonably comfortable.6. The shock absorbers do more than on the few other strollers that have shocks.7. For a stroller of this size/category, it is not too wide, so we can bring it into small shops and navigate tight aisles and turns easily.8. Although not compact, at least this stroller folds up to a decent size that is easy to fit into a car - most strollers in this category are much longer and a little wider than this when folded up.9. Wheels are easily removable.10. Not too heavy - lighter than similar strollers of this type.11. Plenty of accessories available.12. Good, rugged build quality.13. Wheels are made of sturdy plastic = nothing to rust.CONS1. The seat does not recline very far, and it requires you to adjust two straps (one on either side of the top of the seat back).2. The footrest is not adjustable, and I would have preferred a metal/plastic kick plate.3. When you fold the stroller, it is a little awkward to carry because the front wheel sticks out and you can't keep it folded up without rigging the wrist strap - a simple locking mechanism would be better.4. Storage basket could be a little bigger.5. Handlebar is not adjustable, however it is high enough for me (over 6' tall).6. Seat could use a little more padding.  Our son seems to be more comfortable in our little Combi.7. No included accessories.Keep in mind that this kind of stroller is typically stored in a garage and not folded up all the time.  This is an excellent stroller and worth the money.FYI, here's the main reasons why we selected this stroller over similar ones from:Mountain Buggy - canopy doesn't provide much sun protection, too big when folded, seat seams uncomfortable (hammock style, limited padding = squishes the child's shoulders in); great build quality though and easy to fold up.Valco - too difficult to fold up, expensive; fancy stroller with good padding; optional toddler jumper seat looks uncomfortable for toddler if used more than briefly.Phil & Ted's - seems less sturdy, fabric footrest too close to wheel so kids can actually push and impede the front wheel; optional second seat is innovative design, but sacrifices the storage area.Alternative: We were'nt able to actually see/test one, but the Boogie by Zooper looks interesting because it has a great feature set, adjustable footrest with kickplate, full reclining seat back, and comes with great accessories.  Apparently, the 2006 model has been redesigned to be lighter and fix some issues in older models",United States,MD

Then I read up on the swing this pump ALSO (like the symphony) includes the Medela 2-Phase Expression Technology - the new standard for unsurpassed naturalness, comfort and efficiency. AND after buying it.. I liked it BETTER then the symphony. Infact I think it works just about the exact same, which is crazy of Medela when the price is SO different. I have tried the Medela Pump in style as well as the Avant Isis and this one is the best. I would highly reccommend this pump. POSITIVES:This pump is portable. Comes with a travel bag, runs on batteries OR you can plug it in. The pump itself is about the size of a Hardees Hamburger. The breast shield is soft and very effective, you can control the speed and it has the letdown mode as well that automatically turns on after a few minutes.

It is FAST and emptys your breast totally. NEGATIVES: (I have to stretch on this one cause I love the pump) It's not quiet, I don't know why the other review says it is.. It's actually louder then I thought it should be.. but not louder then the Medela Pump in style or symphony.

If used properly, it clamps onto the rim of the potty without being permanently attached.  I found it was difficult to remove, and couldn't remove it just by pulling.  It also doesn't rattle if it's installed on the front half of the toilet and NOT under the little buttons that keep the seat off of the rim.  I have tried it on a variety of toilets.  We were able to have a spare for travel, so every toilet was safe.  I really can't understand what went wrong for the previous reviewer.  I wish I could help her try to install it so it would work. There are two sizes of clamps to fit different sizes of toilet rims, I found I had to use one for our very old upstairs potty and the other for the more modern downstairs potty. You HAVE to clamp them tightly on the rim though, or it won't work, and would certainly rattle.  Maybe that was the problem.The base is a clamp that's adjustable to fit the rim of the toilet tightly.  Then there's a swing-up/down latch that clamps over the lid and seat keeping both of them down.  You have to lift two buttons at the same time as you lift the latch, I found I could easily do it with one hand while holding a newborn, but my toddler, who could easily defeat all of our cabinet, drawer, and door locks just couldn't do it.  Because I did it one handed the trick wasn't obvious.Well, I recommend this to all my friends, and will buy more for my new house",United States,

Dufek,USA- Arizona,"both my 4 year old and my little daughter 5 month old hate having their noses suctioned! My little girl has reflux and spits up a lot,  due to that she always has quite some Milkbuggers up her nose and to add to that, she's teething like a Mammoth right now which makes her congested as well. First she wanted to sqirm away, but the hummingsound that comes from it and the nice Tune it plays destracted her! Since it vibrates quite a bit I first touch her cheek with it so she knows what to expect and she immidetly calmes down and today started even to giggle because it tickled her nose!The long and short tip are both very soft and have no sharp edges and the suction is very gentle. Yes, I do agree that it won't suck crusties out of the nose but even with a bulb,  hard stuff should be soaked for a couple of seconds with a squirt of saline up the nose to soften it. Once you do that the bigger buggers will come out with the big tip!I personally find the Bulbs to invasive and the aspirators in Hospital pretty strong, so strong that not even the stuff will use them unless the Babys oxygen drops due to stuffiness in the nose! I KNOW I just spent 1 week in the hospital in February with my duaghter due to RSV, and yes those aspirators there shouldn't be used  unless there is no other way (but even there they use always saline first to soften the stuff and then use the suction)Oh, by the way, the Aspirator comes with a handy little sack to store the tips and the easy to take apart and clean Aspirator! sure, the Suction is not as strong as the Hospital one but the Hospital cannot be used as often as you want to, this one is gentle enough and even fun for the little ones while giving them relieve and can be used as needed it is that gentle!

I was surprised to learn that babies can't clear their own noses until they are about 3 years old.  I tried using the manual bulb aspirator but my little one would get frustrated and I would have limited success clearing his nose.  It usually took several attempts to get into the nostril and once there, I was only able to get good suction about 1/3 of the time.  Maybe others have better luck than me but these are my stats.I ordered the NasalClear about a week ago.  I was concerned that the vacuum might be too strong for little noses or that the tips would be too invasive.  The vacuum is very gentle.  I prefer the shorter, stouter tip as it seems less likely to go too far up the nostril.  Either tip is certainly shorter than the one on the manual bulb.  The suction, while being gentle, is very effective at cleaning the nostril.  I was surprised by how much a little nostril could hold.  That being said, the NasalClear comes with a collecion cup that has a max fill line on it that seems absurdly large.  I have yet to get even a drop into the chamber (there is quite a bit of storage space in the tubes leading to the chamber that does get filled) so I can't even imagine filling it.  I don't find the music feature to be very important.It's a great product that works well and doesn't irritate my baby.  So far, there hasn't been a tear caused by NasalClear--which is a huge improvement over the manual bulb",United States,CA

We went ahead and bought it, and it was fairly easy to install. Pros: 1) You can angle it so that it custom fits your space. You can also make it longer or shorter without having to buy extensions.2) It has a gate, so you don't have to continuously step over it or take it down.3) Its soft mesh material means fewer bumps on the head for our little one.4) The gate slowly closes after you walk through it (but it doesn't latch shut, FYI).Cons: 1) Although the gate can be opened with one hand, it's not the easiest (you have to move a button and then lift up, not a huge deal, though).2) Its also not the easiest to close (have to lift up and then push down).3) It's wall mounted (not pressure mounted), so it leaves holes in the wall.Overall, I would recommend it",United States,MO

I was worried about the bar below the gate being annoying or tripped over but it is so low to the ground that it has never been an issue.

B000B5HELW,Combi Urban Sling Diaper Bag Black: Baby,baby,12 of 12,5.0,"Great bag, stylish and functional. ","November 9, 2006",Sister Big Bones,Jersey,"I have purchased several diaper bags and received several at my shower. As a person who loves pocketbooks, I'm horribly picky about any bag. But a diaper bag especially should be functional and stylish. The COMBI urban sling is just that. At the time of this writing, I've only had it a week, so I can't speak to it's durability. What you can't see in the pictures on this site are the many pockets in the bag. The front flap closes messenger-style via velcro. There's a zipped pocket which spans the width of the front flap inside the front flap. Upon opening the front flap velcro, there are two pen holders and two compartments/pockets which will fit a wallet, or checkbook or even diapers if that's where you want to put them. There is a zipped compartment on the side of the bag which holds one bottle. This is the only drawback; that only one bottle can go in the insulated compartment. However, in the part of the bag which is the deepest, there are two deep compartments and one zippered compartment on top of a spacious inside. The bottle thing was remedied for me by putting another bottle on the inside compartment in a ziploc bag ( to keep the temperature). The shoulder is heavily padded in the middle of the bag, which is a joy on my shoulders. And the key holding section is convenient as well. On the back of the bag is a compartment which holds a large changing pad. This is one of the best features as the changing pad itself isn't bulky and taking up oo gobs of diaper bag space. I took this bag to the hardest possible test site: the suburban mall. This was his first trip there and I was able to pack two nine ounce bottles, wipes, diapers, a change of clothes, his medicines, disposable changing pads, a receiving blankie (albeit thin), my wallet and essentials and still had pockets in the bag that were empty. With the rubberized shoulder pad I didn't have to worry about the bag falling off of my shoulder as it rubbed against my shirt. (I know I'm not the only one who is sick of readjusting bags on their shoulder over and over). And the way it is designed, it leaned flat on my hip instead of jutting out. Made turning those store corners with a stroller much less difficult. And the bag came in super handy on his doctor's visit yesterday in the middle of heavy rain. The material seems waterproof. I really love this bag. As I'm on maternity leave now, I am using it strictly for the baby. However, as someone who works in social services and is often at meetings and in the field in neighborhoods, I can see using this bag transitioning to work upon my return. If it holds up, it also seems the perfect bag for those theme park trips. Overall it was money well spent. ",Jersey,

They are great most of the time.  I freeze about 10-12oz in each bag (yes, they say no more than 6oz, it's a myth). 12 is the maximum I found tho. The trick is to make sure there is no air.  It won't leak b/c the bag will expand, unlike plastic storage containers.  I use the straight edge of a table, push the milk all the way to the top and zip it as I push the air out.  Don't worry if a little leaks out b/c it has a double zipper.  Then I freeze it on a flat surface singly.  After it's frozen, I put 8-10 of these in a big gallon zip lock bag and date the outside and put it in deep freezer.  It's easier to organize them this way in deep freeze.The bad thing about these bags is that once frozen, the plastic nicks easily if you drop it, scrape it against something, etc (as with all frozen containers).  Lansinoh had really bad problem with leakage before but they've improved.  Just thaw the bag in a container in case it leaks.

B000EDJ1A8,Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat &#45; Black: Baby,baby,3 of 3,5.0,Excellent seat protector,"February 21, 2007",Research Techie,"Palm Beach County, FL USA","After using the Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat for 4 months, I purchased two more mats. This is the best seat protector I found for several reasons:- It doesn't smell. I had to return everything I had bought at Babies R Us due to a heavy rubber smell that never went away even after airing the products for a week.- It's made of two pieces so it can be used in stages. Use the bottom piece only when using a rear-facing infant seat, or both pieces when using a front-facing car seat.- It's made of two pieces so it fits any height car seat. I have a Britax car seat which is really tall. The other seat protectors did not reach all the way to the top of my SUV's seat, so the car seat rested directly on the leather, but with this seat protector, I could raise the back piece as high as I needed it to fully protect my SUV's seat.- It's thick enough that even after months of use, there's no marks on the SUV's leather seats.- It has indentations in the bottom portion to accommodate car seats using the latch system.A note on the height issue: A friend of mine bought the Duomat 2-In-1 Car Seat Mat, which he found to be very nice as well and it did not smell. He had to return it however due to the fact that the mat was not as high as the seat of his Honda Odyssey, and his Britax Marathon car seat at the very top rested directly on the Honda seat with no protector in between",United States,FL

I received it as a gift and I'm so glad that I registered for it. True, the velcro isn't too strong, which makes it slip if alot of heavy items are placed on it. However, I used the strategy that another reviewer used and tied it to the crib with some pretty ribbon and it works wonderfully. I have powder, lotion, baby oil, vaseline, some shoes, as well as a package of diapers and a few more items stored in it and it is holding up fine. I think this organizer can be a very useful and convenient way to keep the much needed items close at hand, especially if you are lacking storage space. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone and I'm so glad that I did finally register for it. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because I did have to make an adjustment, being using the ribbons instead of the velcro that it came with.

I never experienced sore nipples with him. My second son is a whole different story though. For some reason my second son just didn't want to open his mouth wide enough to get a good latch on, so that made for excruciatingly sore nipples for me for about the first two weeks of nursing. It was torture - pure torture. A nurse at the hospital gave me these gel patches to help with my sore nipples and I must say, I don't know what I would have done with out them (I probably would have given up on breastfeeding). I tried the nipple cream and that did help a bit, but these gel patches are really what made breastfeeding manageable for me. I healed faster wearing them than I did with the nipple cream. If you put the patches in the fridge for a couple of minutes then put them on they feel really great. This is a wonderful product and I attribute them to getting over that huge breastfeeding hurtle for the first two weeks.  ",United States,CO

Good clear signal even between multi-floors.  Durable hand sets with a easy to use switch between the base (the babies room) and the other hand set.  Easy to use. durable and reliable. Good volumn control. Good response from manufacture and from Amazon when a switch went bad.  Can't ask for more than that even if it cost twice what I paid.  I strongly recommend this set and product. I have used others and they can't touch this one. My babies and more importantly my wife's emotional well being were a serious consideration on finding something that would make them feel safe and in communication.

I actually bought a Bumbo Seat, hoping I could use this instead of a high chair, but that didn't work out too well.  So I was pretty excited when I saw this high chair and read good reviews.  I'm happy to report that I love this this high chair! The vinyl seat is pretty plush and looks comfortable.  He actually looks like he's sitting on a little throne when he's in it.  I strapped it onto a barstool, and it feels very secure.  The vinyl seat, along with the rest of the chair material, is easy to clean.  The tray says dishwasher safe, but my dishwasher is too small to accommodate it.  It doesn't seem to be the highest quality chair, meaning some of the functions aren't as easy to use as you might hope, like the reclining seat and the tray, but it wouldn't deter me from buying it again.

We have a more expensive, larger, ""safer"" stroller with more features, but we have found we never use it and always use this one.Collapsing the stroller to pop into the car is a breeze, and there is an adequate shoulder strap for you to carry the stroller when you are doing portage over rough ground.We take the stroller everywhere. We've used it on well-groomed trails for hiking, museums, restaurants, we've even used it at the beach, and we've used it on the Paris Metro. This is a great stroller for train and subway travel.The wheels have a lock feature which allows them to rotate, or swivel, and the rear wheels have a brake mechanism which is a little awkward to release, but I find that comforting rather than frustrating: I want solid brakes.There is a small basket in the back of the stroller for a baby bag, purse, and a few groceries, so this again is an excellent stroller for when you are just running out for a few things or going on a small picnic. If I was an apartment dweller in the city, this is the stroller I'd get.The only bad feature: this is not a stroller you can run with! Don't even try.The harness is excellent, but takes time to adjust it correctly so that it is not too snug nor too loose. This is a super lightweight stroller, but is a quality product with excellent engineering and design. It is not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways and just has the MacLaren name on it: this is the real deal. We have used it for two kids, still works like new.

I cannot get over how many parents assume that the Avent line is alot of ""hype"" just because they failed to read directions.As for the complaints about mold and sour milk...that's just gross.  Wash the sippy cup after it's used.  I'm sure any other brand would get moldy and smelly if you left it in your trunk all summer...not Avent's fault!Anyway, as for the green spouts being stiffer than the white ones and more difficult to clean...OK, maybe for the first few times because they are new; but they WILL get more pliable.  I spoke to an Avent rep at the Baby Fair in Edison, NJ and she suggested buying new spouts every month or so (same for nipples with Avent bottles).  They do wear out...especially if you're using the same two or three sippy cups every day.I just bought (and tried) the ""sport spout"" and although it is quite a mouthful of liquid that comes out, our son has no problem with that spout, either.

It can either be plugged in or ran by batteries.  I couldn't be more pleased with the monitor.  I would recommend it because it is worth every cent",United States,MI

Walts,"Rochester, NY, USA","Years ago with my first child, I learned to hate those cliché, oversized diaper bags, especially when most of my outings were short errands. Why bring what amounts to a piece of luggage on those short trips? This diaper bag is the ULTIMATE in functionality for brief jaunts, holding a truly amazing amount of stuff, but holding it stylishly, to boot. It may look small, but I can carry three or four diapers, a small container of wipes, a change of clothes, a nursing shawl, a burp cloth or two, spare baby socks and a hat, a teething ring or two, a snack, my wallet, keys, Palm pilot, a tube of diaper rash cream, and a few other odds and ends in there with no problem. There are lots of zip compartments to keep it all organized. I get a lot of compliments on it, which is strange considering it's a diaper bag. In fact, a woman stopped me in the store the other day and wanted to know where I'd gotten it, because it was ""exactly the purse she'd been looking for""-- she was shocked to learn it was a diaper bag! It's sporty enough that my husband and 13-y.o. son don't mind carrying it, either. If you're going on a day trip, you'll need something bigger, but for those typical ""quickie"" errands, you can't beat this bag",United States,NY

Sanders,"San Antonio, TX","I had originally tried another type of shopping cart cover which was difficult to use.  A friend of mine was using the Buggy Bagg and I was impressed that she was able to install it in the cart with one hand while holding her baby in the other.  I liked that the Buggy Bagg *completely* covered anywhere the baby might touch.  It comes with a pillow but frankly the padded back and seat were so comfortable that I never needed to use the it. (You may find the pillow more useful with a younger baby that isn't sitting up steadily yet.)  I've also used it to cover a restaurant high chair - the fit is very tight and a bit lopsided, but if you have a small baby it works out great!The large pockets on the back are also a great feature.  I keep wipes, diapers and diaper cream in the large pocket all the time, and the smaller pockets come in handy while I'm shopping for my sunglasses and coupons. ",United States,TX

B0006NDDP0,Babe Ease Whimsical Clean Shopper: Baby,baby,1 of 1,5.0,Great product,"November 5, 2006",MKMom,"Jacksonville, FL",We've been using this cart cover for four months now and have really liked it.  I originally ordered it to provide a little extra cushioning in the cart seat but have liked that I can attach a toy to it and stuff a bottle in the pocket.  When my son goes through a teething phase it's handy as a barrier over the various carts.  It's much easier to throw the cover over the cart than wipe down the entire seat.  I like the whimsical pattern--it's so bright and cheery.  We're expecting a baby girl in a couple of months and are happy to be able to use this pattern with her also.  We've also used it as a highchair cover in restaurants from time to time.  It's a little bulky but functions as a great crumb catcher,United States,FL
B0006NDDP0,Babe Ease Whimsical Clean Shopper: Baby,baby,11 of 11,4.0,"Good product, but not perfect","July 31, 2006",JujubeMBA,USA,"My son is 7 months old and just started sitting in high chairs at restaurants and shopping carts.  So far, the Clean Shopper is working pretty well for us.The fabric is thick, so it doesn't make a tiny package.  It also doesn't fold up neatly, so you have to kind of just wad it up.  It isn't cushioned, but if it were it would be huge, and I have enough issue trying to carry my son, a cart cover, my purse, and whatever else I might need.  Besides, he doesn't really need cushioning.  Even at 7 months, he's perfectly comfy on the thick bedspread-like fabric.The Clean Shopper comes in a thick plastic bag (the sort of thing bedspreads or other linens come in) that zips closed.  It's a snug fit to get in there because of the wadded nature of the bundle, but it works fine.  The handle is short and taut, so isn't of much use.  A longer strap so it could be shoulder worn or hung on a stroller would be better.The loops work well, and it's a relief to have a clean place my son can sit and play with anchored toys.  He can't throw the toys in the floor, and he stays entertained.There are velcro tabs on the front that can be fastened around the front of a shopping cart or high chair.  This keeps it in place better.  The leg holes don't match up exactly with whatever he's sitting in, but it doesn't cause a problem.My main problem with the Clean Shopper is that the belt strap does not attach to the seat.  It's a completely seperate piece.  Unless you are careful to snap the belt clips together, looping the belt around a part of the seat, you will end up losing the strap.  Somehow I've lost mine after only a few uses.  I kept it rolled up inside the thing when I removed it from a cart, and it probably fell out in a parking lot somewhere.  When handling a baby, your purse, whatever is in your cart (or trying to eat at a restaurant), it is very easy to overlook such a small item.Since the website sells replacement straps, it seems they are aware of the issue.  It's a shame they don't have velcro tabs that stick it to the back of the shopper, making it harder to lose the strap.  I've ordered two replacements in black, so I can see the strap more clearly against my blue Clean Shopper.  I will also make certain I buckle the strap clips.It's a good seat cover overall, definitely worth having.  Just be careful of the strap",United States,

Cecchini ""Mom""","Hudson, NH","I love my clean shopper and every time I use it, I have at least one person asking me where I got it.  I also buy it as baby gifts for all of my friends.  It's the best purchase that I've bought.  There are no strings to tie, no velcro to deal with, no snaps or buttons...it's just a piece of fabric that covers pretty much all size carts.  To keep my now toddler occupied while I shop (I still use it for him) I place some goldfish either next to him, or in front of him and he eats them while I shop.  Those who say there is no cushioning, that's not really the purpose of the clean shopper!  It's purpose is to act as a buffer between you and the cart.  If there was cushion to it and tons of bells and whistles, then it would be too bulky and too cumbersome to deal with.

I am even able to use it over restaurant high chairs (not a perfect fit - but covers everything). There are little loops to hook toys into in the front and inside side pockets to stash snacks or whatever (I hide my wallet in there while shopping sometimes). It is a bit large when folded (to big to fit in diaper bag if you have more than a few diapers in it), but that is due to the nice soft and durable fabric. It comes in a plastic carrying case with a handle (I'm guessing it's about 12""x8"" and about 2""thick - I leave mine in the car).

The inner lining is soft against your baby's skin and the outside lining protects him/her against cool weather and rain.  The only negative thing I have to say about this is that it does not fit as well on my car seat as the Original.  It tends to slide down a little.  I have the new Graco Safe Seat which is larger than most car seats so this could be the reason.  It may fit better on smaller car seats.  I also love the pink ""girly"" color.

No, I didn't usually install it with one hand while holding my daughter (although I did a few times - it's not that hard); I normally parked near a cart, put the cover on & ran the belt through, THEN took my daughter out of her car seat & placed her in the shopping cart.  (Why carry your baby & heavy diaper bag through the parking lot if you don't need to! :-) ) It was a bit stiff to get into the stuff sack at first, but after one or two washings, it was a cinch to put it in the stuff sack when we were finished using it. It fit all the shopping carts we used, including the oversized ones at Costco.  It's held up well to repeated washings - a bit faded, but still looking fairly bright.There was hardly a time that we went shopping that someone didn't come over & say ""Oh! I wish we'd had one of those when my children were small"".  Overall, we were very pleased with this product",United States,CO

B000JOT4DG,Floppy Seat Shopping Cart Seat Cover: Baby,baby,1 of 1,5.0,Only cover that fits Costco & Sam's Club carts,"January 18, 2007",Laura Kyriakopoulos,USA,"I started out with a different shopping cart cover that I bought at the grocery store. It worked ok, but it didn't work at all at Costco because the carts are extra wide.  I bought the floppy seat and it works like a charm.  It's the only one I've found that's wide enough for the Costco and Sam's Club carts.  And, it's fluffy, comfy, and easy to use.  Regarding the one reviewer's comment - yes, you do have to feed the strap through the back - but every shopping cart cover out there requires you to do that.  I can't get it on with one hand, but it's big enough that I can put it in the seat, put my son in the seat, and then get it perfectly situated once he's sitting and strapped in.  My only complaint is that it's pretty big, but if it were smaller it probably wouldn't fit the big carts - which is why I like it so much in the first place.  Plus, it covers every inch so my very curious son can't find random shopping cart or highchair spots to suck",United States,

I find it very comfortable, and am easily able to pump 4 or more ounces in under 10 minutes. I used a Medela electric pump (I do not know which model) once and found the Avent Isis manual pump allowed me to pump more milk in less time.  The *only* thing I would suggest is for new mothers (and their significant others) to practice assembling the pump a few times prior to the arrival of their little one.

If you use a Medela pump, you can get an adapter and pump straight into these containers, eliminating a step in the breastmilk collection chain. I also find that the small sizes are convenient, especially if you normally pump four ounces or less out of one or both breasts.I didn't give this product five stars, though, because, really, these are just four more Avent bottles with a sealing disc.

Now that we are expecting another munchkin, we planning on using them again. I loved these. I loved how simple it made it to store my milk. Straight from the Isis Pump to my fridge/freezer. Simple. Yes, the defrosting takes longer than some alternatives, but I always had a bottle in the fridge while one was defrosting. I found warming it in a boiling pot of water to work the best for quick defrost. They do take up more room than the bags when storing, but I think the convience outweighed that problem. I stored milk in the fridge and freezer and learned to rotate so room wasn't a terrible problem. (If you do this, it is important to label and date the containers) This also saved me from defrosting last minute. I had some leaking issues from time to time, but figured it out. If you tighten the container/bottle too much it will leak. Simple fix...don't over-tighten. (Avent's site has a short trouble shooting list for leakage problems) We tried other products, but Avent was the best for our family. ",United States,ID

These nipples work great as long as the formula is too thick to use in a regular stage 1 or 2 nipple. The only problem i have found with these nipples is that you have to be gentle when you are using a nipple brush to clean them so that you don't tear the y-cut opening.....2 of our nipples tore at the cuts causing the hole to become larger. But gentler cleaning and checking the nipples before each use has remedied this problem. Also want to add that my son started using these nipples at the age of 2 months and has had no problems sucking from them.,United States,CO

Holak,"Kingwood, TX USA","LOVE that this stroller is so light weight.  I purchased this stroller for our second child.  I wanted something super light since I would have 2 kids to trek around with.  I was tired of the big Evenflo travel system I had from our first child.  I can take this in and out of the car easily with one hand. I've never had an issue with the steering as others have stated.  There were some complaints about the harness.  It sounds to me that they just did not read the directions.  I use the 5 point harness everytime I put my daughter, now 20 months, in the stroller.  The harness is simple to use and is very secure.  The stroller hood is easy to keep clean/dry.  Any liquid that drops on the fabric just beads up, you can wipe or flick it off.I even ran over this stroller with our minivan and it works as well as the day we bought it.  The snack tray bent, but that was the only dammage to stroller.  I was easily able to order a replacement.The only complaint I have is the lousy adult cup holder hanging from one side of the handlebar.  It doesn't stay in place, and my water bottle slips out easily. I did see this stroller at Sea World last weekend.  I saw a Peg Aria with a tray and cup holder that extends to each side of the stroller just below the handlebar.   Check with Peg.I would definately puchase this stroller again",United States,TX

Also I felt that my son was already growing out of it. I did alot of research, wanted a light, easy-to-handle stroller and a bit bigger than my Combi. I purchased the Aria a few days ago, after ALOT of steering in the store, with my son in it. I found no problem with the steering, as a matter of fact it was so easy to steer, even with one hand. My son has more elbow room in his new stroller, and the snack tray is great. I don't use the 5pt harness much, but the times that I have I had no problem with it. The basket is great, lots of room.  As far as the cup holder for the parent, it isn't big by any means, but I never carry around a 32 oz big gulp, so it isn't a problem for me. I usually have a small bottle of water or small Starbucks cup. Unless you travel with large cups or bottles, it works just fine.

Harris,"Orange County, CA","After reading over reviews of nearly every wipe warmer out there, including Prince Lionheart brand, we decided to go ahead and buy this one and we are SO HAPPY WITH IT!  Since you leave the wipes in their plastic they do not dry out at all!  The wipes are so nice and warm and our son LOVES THEM!  He can actually sleep through diaper changes and he is only 2 weeks old!  This model warms from the top so it doesn't dry out the wipes and there is actually liquid still left in the plastic by the time we run out and change to a new pack of wipes!  We go through an 80 pack refill per week with no problems whatsoever and you DO NOT add any water or anything to this warmer - just plug it in and leave it plugged in and pop in some wipes.  ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE is that there is a mechanism in this warmer that keeps the wipes pushed to the top so you never have to reach down in there to get wipes - a hard to find feature with warmers!  They do not brown and they are perfectly warm for about 10 seconds out of the warmer - plenty of time to wipe their bottoms off!  We HIGHLY recommend this warmer - it is THE BEST in our opinion as new parents",United States,CA

When you first get them the are thick and fluffy - so soft! After some washes (in Washing Soda and Borax) I found that mine aren't as soft, but they are still very nice. They are thick. My baby is a heavy wetter and rarely soaks all the way through these. The picture on this website makes it look like the front of the diaper isn't contoured, but it is. It is just not as wide in the front as in the back, as it should be. If you like you can just use these with a pin on either side and they'd work great without anything else, though there is no elastic to prevent leaks out the side and the outside would get damp. You also can't tell from the picture that there is a rectangular doubler sewn into the inside of these - with one line of stitching right down the center to hold it in place. It is the full length of the diaper. I think I would have rather had it stitched on both sides so one side wouldn't accidentally get folded over the wrong way, but then perhaps that would have caused bunching problems.I use the Bummis Super Whisper Wrap diaper covers with these and they fit perfectly.

I think that's a really important feature - especially in this season when my kid may be wearing a jacket one day and none the next and also if you use the car seat for different kids that are similar but not exactly the same size.  I have another car seat without that and I find that sometimes I can't get it closed because it's too tight and sometimes there's too much slack,United States,NY

We had been using our baby Bjorn, but it was starting to hurt our backs and especially our shoulders, and the padding got lumpy after i washed it. I received my wrap on Friday, I have walked to the lake and back with my daughter in the wrap everyday since... we have tried the Joey and hug positions, and I can feel her weight a little in the Joey one, but on the way home, I turn her around into the hug position, and she falls asleep... and it feels like I'm not even carrying a baby!  The weight distribution is great and now I have no excuses to not get out and exercise!  :) She seems to love it too! I have two friends who are due in the next three months, and I think I will have to get them their own as baby shower gifts!

I remember cringing as I spent the $100 but we now joke that it was the best $100 we ever spent.  It really was.We have traveled all over the country with the stroller - it's lightweight, extremely collapsable and comes with a shoulder strap that was a genious addition.  The wheels don't stick like cheaper umbrella strollers, it can take a beating and still keep going.  At 4 years and 42 lbs it still carried my son without a squeek. (Ok we did WD-40 the wheels once in the 4 years we had it.) The mesh backing made cleaning the stroller a breeze.  It can easily be steered with one hand, and we personally loved the shape of the handles and the handle padding  - pushing other strollers feels so awkward now.  The basket underneath is incredibly handy and carries a surprising amount.  It folds easily with one hand and foot.  My son doesn't use a stroller anymore but the Volo still looks and works perfectly so we are saving it for our next child.  Bottom line, this stroller is worth every penny you pay for it.The ONE and only complaint I have about the stroller is that it would be nice if the seat reclined for younger infants.  If you are thinking about purchasing this stroller for younger infants consider spending the extra $ for the model that does recline.  A sun visor might be something to consider too",United States,FL

Also, the directions that came with the crib said nothing about the washers that were included in the hardware. We just sort of had to figure out to use them with the bolts.

The lactation consultant suggested the Soothie products to improve my daughter's latch because of the long round nipple shape that's more natural for nursing babies.  It's too soon to see if it made a difference, but my daughter LOVES the soothie bottles and paci's now!  It took weeks before she'd take a Mam and over a week before she'd successfully drink from a Gerber bottle, but she took to Soothies instantly and in 5 mins or less prefered them to the products she'd been using for months!  They're so much easier for her to suck and hold in her mouth.  The price is great too, about 1/2 the price of the same set with Avent products.  My 2 complaints are: 1) the leaking bottles and 2) the pacifier looks weird and doesn't attach to a pacifier keeper.  The leaking can be fixed by getting the part where the rim of the bottle meets the nipple wet to create a full seal.  Also, it helps to ""swirl"" the formula to mix instead of ""shaking"" it... it takes a bit longer, but you end up with less mess and less bubbles",United States,OH

Haven't had the chance to put our little guy in it yet, but so far I believe we will be very happy with it.  I do plan on getting the round teether covers for the top rails, since I don't want him scratching it up with his teeth! Would recommend it to anyone, especially at this price.  ",United States,IL
B0007VZVAQ,BreathableBaby&#153; Crib Bumper &#45; Sage Gingham: Baby,baby,9 of 9,4.0,Peace of mind for parents - and not bad lookin'!,"March 28, 2006",K. DeJong,"Tri-Cities, WA  USA","     I searched online for sage colored crib bedding for weeks before my daughter was born and finally settled on something close. I was satisfied that it matched well enough to maintain the cuteness of her nursery (of utmost importance) and was affordable at the same time. I had seen the breathable bumpers but opted for the ""cuter"" bedding, confident that my child would be safe.     My daughter started sleeping through the night at 8 weeks which meant I was not going into her room for 7-9 hours at a time, depending on the night.  Even though I swaddle her for sleeping, she still manages to travel around her crib during the night as well as during longer naps.     One morning when I heard her wake up, I went into her room to find that she had wiggled her way down to the southwest corner of her crib and her face was pressed up against the ""adorable, nursery-matching, affordable"" crib bumper.  I jerked that bumper out of the bed and ran down to order a breathable bumper.      Since I put it on her crib she has been pressed up against it two or three times and is able to breath.  I am delighted because I think it's actually cuter than the one I had before and I don't have to worry at all (at least about that!).  It's a very clean look and the green gingham matches the crib skirt I got perfectly.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the fit.  It comes in 2 pieces:  one for the side of the crib that moves up and down and one for the other 3 sides.  This leaves 2 openings, one at each end of the front of the crib, that an arm or leg could potentially get stuck in.  It hasn't been a problem for us yet as she has quit the southwest travelling and now just spins in place. However, I would much rather risk a let getting stuck than having a suffocated baby.  I have no regrets about buying this and am advising all of my pregnant friends to consider the breathable option over the puffy ones",United States,TN

Sure, we keep Potty-toppers with us, but sometimes that just isn't enough.  This On The Go Potty is far better than any porta-potty or gross outdoor park restroom.  We have used this potty at the park, while making rounds at build/construction sites, at baseball games, even in the parking garage of our hockey rink!  Our daughter can use it just about anywhere.

B0007SMK0S,Foldaway Portable Crib &#150; Natural: Baby,baby,16 of 16,4.0,Very useful crib,"March 26, 2006",Sunburst,"Houston, TX","We love this crib - we looked at several bassinettes and pack-n-plays because we wanted to have our baby in our room with us for the first few months before transitioning her to her big crib in her room, but we also wanted something versatile that could be used for her to play in (we have hard wood floors and I wanted something I could push around the house from room to room so she could be with me).  This crib is so much more attractive than pack-n-plays but functional and lasts so much longer than other cradles or bassinettes.  One of the biggest advantages is that it fits through doorways, which the pack-n-play does not, and I had wanted something I could roll around from room to room.  This was useful when she was a newborn and we wanted to keep her in the room with us, or just push her to the next room where we could hear her.  I also plan to use it to roll around the house when she is older and is using it to play in.  The nice thing about it is that it works just like a regular crib with the side that lowers and the mattress level which has two settings.  The other reviewer is right, you can push it up to your bed if you want a co-sleeper type of bed, and you could even lower the side down for easy reach of the baby.   I have not used it this way but it would be the perfect thing if my baby got sick.  Tho other thing I love about this crib is that as a sleeper or play area, it lasts much longer than a bassinnett or cradle - as long as a pack n play- I believe up to 50 pounds.  Finally, it is really nice looking, and since we have it in our master bedroom, I wanted something that would be cute and not bulky or would stand out too much.  This one is really attractive.  Negatives:  The mattress is pretty wimpy, which is why I gave this 4 stars.  But she, at just 6 months, is still sleeping on it at night and seems to be very comfortable in it.  For the next baby, I will probably look around for another mattress.  The other negative is that the crib does not travel too well - unlike the pack-n-play.  It does fold up for easy storage, but unless you have a minivan or SUV, it is still pretty large to store in a trunk - it does not fit into our volvo 4-door car trunk.  I would also recommend buying one of the port-a-crib bumper pad sets (around 40-50.00) from Babies R Us because they fit this crib the best.  I bought the 15.00 Koala Kids bumper pad and it is too big and buckles around the bed, so I only recently started using the bumper pad for fear that she would press up against it at night.  But you need a bumper pad with the crib as they get older because they start sticking their legs and arms out the slats while asleep.  Nice crib - good choice.    ",United States,TX

B000CENF3I,Baby Trend Baby Trend Flex Lock Car Seat Galaxy: Baby,baby,1 of 1,4.0,"Overall really great, only 1 big con","April 9, 2007",A. Thompson,"Salt Lake City, Utah","I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat.  I HATED it. It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked.  I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc.  At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings, but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded, I still liked a lot of the features.Pros:-very comfy seat, good padding -the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely- the canopy stays in place; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind the seat- the tightening mechanism under the baby's feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing- the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust (the shoulder strap height). My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible.  The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn--it's a breeze.- The seat can be transfered between cars without the base.  It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it.- the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position- this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo- The cloth is very wipeable, not as absorbant of spills and stains as my EvenfloCons:I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat, and one that might (depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend).- The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat.  It's a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing.- As others have said, the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff, but not horribly so.  I was prepared for them to be way worse.- The handle is thinner and doesn't FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around, but it hasn't had any problems-This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on:  Twice when I have turned a corner sharply, the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle!  I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could, putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism.  But maybe I'm still not doing it right.  The base is narrower than my Evenflo's was, so maybe that's why?  So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions.  Until then, I guess I'll take the corners slower!Overall, I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store.  It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows. I would recommend it for sure.  Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it",United States,UT

He's finally gotten the hang of jumping and he also realizes that he's the one controlling all of the sounds. The only drawbacks I see with it, and the reason I can only give 4 out of 5 stars, is that the volume setting goes from loud to EXTREMELY loud. I wish there was one more quieter setting.

Just put the jumper in a wide doorway and you won't have the problem of the baby hitting their hand against to doorway or whatever people complained about.

Even the ""knock-off"" tubs of play food are primarily junk food - hot dogs, donuts, cupcakes, ice cream cones, etc.  I chose this set because it consists of the foods my daughter primarily eats - fruits and vegetables, eggs, cheese, bread, etc.  Some of the pieces are solid plasic, and some are hollow, which leaves a greater question of durability.  But even the hollow pieces are made of a very thick, rather ridged plastic which I think will stand up OK over time.  I am not even able to squeeze them myself.  I also like that the foods are on the small side and actually fit in the small pots and pans sets available right now (although we set aside a few questionably small things, like the carrots and mushrooms, until she is older).  Definitely worth the price, I think, when free shipping is available.",United States,NE
B00007KUQO,The First Years - Alert Ear Thermometer: Baby,baby,2 of 2,5.0,"READ the Instructions, and Don't Worry About Probe Covers.","January 13, 2007","Lisa Evans ""life coach and mom""","Columbus, OH USA","I've owned this thermometer for three years now, and I still love it....even though I ran out of probe covers a long time ago.  My husband and I both use it, and it works great on our 3 year old boy.  (The beeping of the thermometer makes him giggle, even when he's sick.)  As far as the probe covers go, we've found that it works just fine without them.  We use rubbing alcohol to clean off the probe tip in between uses, just as we always did with the old-school mercury thermometers our parents had when we were growing up.  Yes, the instruction book for this ear thermometer says that the probe covers help ensure accuracy, but we haven't found that to be a problem.  Keep in mind that this thermometer is ONLY for use with babies OVER 6 months old because the ear canals of newborns aren't large enough to accomodate an ear thermometer.  Exceptionally accurate temperature measurements are very important for newborns (so use a different type of thermometer - not an ear thermometer), but usually all we really need for older babies, children and adults is a measure of ""normal"", ""a little above normal"", or ""significantly above normal.""  In my opinion, if the temperature is over 101, you ought to be calling your pediatrician anyway.If the probe covers really do matter to you, pull out that instruction manual and READ IT.  It specifies that you can use any brand of probe covers and recommends a particular model number of Walgreens brand covers.  In my opinion, The First Years company is being VERY helpful with regard to the probe covers - the instruction manual does not say ""You must buy ONLY our brand of probe covers.""  Instead, they make it clear that just about any brand will work (as long as the style is similar) and even specify a brand that is readily available from a particular national drugstore chain.The factor that DOES significantly affect accuracy is how you hold the thermometer and the ear.  The instruction manual includes both descriptions and diagrams that show how to hold the child's (or adult's) ear and insert the probe tip.  It's VERY important that you use the right ""ear-holding technique"".  For smaller babies, you pull the back of the ear STRAIGHT BACK and hold it while inserting the probe tip.  But for older children and adults, you pull the top of the ear UP and hold it while inserting the probe tip.  When I neglect to hold the ear in the proper position, I always get inaccurate results.  (I know for a fact that my normal temperature is not 95 degrees, but that's what it reads if I hold my ear incorrectly.)  When I hold the ear in the correct position (depending on the age and size of the person whose temperature I'm taking), I get very accurate results.  My guess is that the people who have complained about the accuracy of this thermometer did not read the instructions, because the diagrams in the manual show you quite clearly how to hold the ear and thermometer.  Also, some of the reviewers mentioned getting inaccurate results on their young babies (e.g., 3 months old).  Remember - this thermometer is NOT for babies under 6 months.  It's not intended to be used for newborns, so you shouldn't expect accurate results when you use it on a newborn.  Plus, I can't imagine trying to stick the probe tip into the ear of a newborn.  That would hurt!So, my bottom line is that this is a GREAT thermometer, as long as you use it properly.  And, the probe covers really aren't a big deal.  Get well soon!  :",United States,OH

We've used it through all stages, including rear-facing, and now forward facing with my currently 19 month old toddler.  The seat is easy to adjust as baby grows, and easy to install using the Latch system.  The removable infant padding was perfect.  Biggest bonus is the adjustable crotch strap with padded cover shield to prevent chafing and scratching between baby's legs.  I'm due with my next baby in a month and have already added a second one of these to my baby registry.  A wonderful car seat...you will not be disappointed.  (Note that this seat is quite heavy, and best for permanent installation in a single car.

B000EFQX0C,Britax Decathlon Onyx: Baby,baby,97 of 99,5.0,Decathlon vs. Boulevard,"June 21, 2006","A. Barber ""Nor Cal Mama""","California, USA","It took me several weeks before I finally opted to purchase the Decathlon rather than the Boulevard.  I was very interested in the extra side-impact protection that is only available in the Boulevard model but was concerned about whether or not my large 4&1/2 month old son (who is in the 95th percentile in length and weight) would need the adjustable crotch strap positioning that is only offered on the Decathlon.  I am so glad that I purchased the Decathlon!  It turns out that my son DID indeed need to have the crotch strap adjusted to the last slot (he would be sitting on top of the buckle in the Boulevard at this point which would have made it impossible to buckle and very uncomfortable for him).  If you're purchasing for a thin toddler rather than an infant or chubby/big baby you might not have to worry about that. I love the extra padding (which is removable, unlike the pads in the Boulevard) and the soft cover (which is machine washable unlike that in the Boulevard). He seems to be VERY comfortable and I know that he is safe.  I know that it doesn't offer as much side-impact protection as the Boulevard, but it does offer some (definitely much more than a conventional car seat) as it is made to far exceed American safety standards. Plus, if your baby is placed in the middle of the back seat than that offers some additional protection as well.I was also concerned about the size of the car seat and whether or not it would fit comfortably, rear-facing, in the back of my Toyota Avalon car. It does. Perfectly! My husband is 6'4"" and doesn't have to move his seat up to accomodate the car seat in back (something I was very concerned about). AND I can see out of the rear-view mirror with no problem. It DOES NOT block your view at all.It's very easy to install and, if done so properly, doesn't budge. It is a little tough to adjust the straps when it's installed rear-facing but not too difficult... and even if you had to take it out to adjust the straps it's no-biggy because the carseat takes only a couple moments to install EASILY and it's not like you'll have to adjust them on a daily basis or anything. I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend the Decathlon to anyone looking for a SAFE, COMFY and ATTRACTIVE carseat that will take them from the chubby baby stage all the way through the toddler years. :o)",United States,CA

I have a two-year-old son and a five-month-old daughter and both kids like facing forward. I also like the side-by-side style. I couldn't see myself pushing a ""stretch limo"" as I've heard it called. It's easy to maneuver, I can fit down most aisles, and it fits in the trunk of my compact car with a full load of groceries. Drawbacks: the canopy could be a bit higher, (my son thinks it's a game when I pull it forward and immediately pushes it back), the seat covers are velcroed in place and tend to slip when I put the kids in, and I need to fold it before it will fit through the front door of the house. I've also taken it on two cross-country plane trips with layovers. Baggage handlers in general aren't very gentle and the front bars come off fairly easily when the stroller is folded.

The only reason I got this to begin with was because when I removed the old traditional fluffy cotton bumper pads, which I realized weren't safe, my 4 month old would squirm around, and his legs or an arm would end up sticking out of the slats and he would get stuck. So I realized I needed something to block the slats. I was happy to find this new breathable bumper to keep his arms and legs in the crib. My only concern was whether or not I'd be able to easily change the crib sheet once this was installed. And I can! My husband secured this bumper (velcro pads) extremely tight all the way around. Spend the few extra minutes to do that (it takes 2 people) and then you will not have to remove the bumper to get the sheets off! I can even completely pull the mattress out of the crib to get the sheets off easier if I need to, and the bumper stays in place since it fits so snugly against the sides of the crib. It's almost like it's not even there. I HIGHLY recommend this product",United States,VA

B0007XTN5S,Playtex Hip Hammock Standard Black/Black: Baby,baby,2 of 2,4.0,Love it! ,"February 26, 2007",January Flower,"Midwest, USA","I carried my first child everywhere in this.  She didn't care for the stroller and who would?  With the hip hammock she was carried around, able to see everything at eye level (instead of looking at everyone's knees) was close to mommy (or daddy) and got cuddled constantly.  I would walk the mall for hours with her in there, She slept in it and I could sit down with her in it and rest or even feed her.   I loved that I never needed to take it off, but even when I did it's so simple!  The trick to getting it to fit well is to make sure the waist strap is very snug and the child should be slightly in front of your hip, not actually on the side.  I put my girl in, make sure she's evenly positioned in the middle of the ""seat"" and then pull her closely to me  while adjusting the shoulder strap.  You do have to pull it nice and tight, but not so tight that it rides up on your neck. I recommend trying it at home at first and getting it just how you like it-then only undo the front strap to take it off.  Otherwise you will have to pull at front and back when you're ""out"" and that's difficult.  I found the best positioning for baby and mom is to have the baby's back arm under the mother's arm which is then draped over the child's back and can then easily ""hold"" the bottom of the hammock or just hang free.  I found that I didn't actually have to ""hold"" my daughter while she was in the hammock.    My big complaint is that the strap gets twisted in the padding and eventually there is no fixing it.  I wish they would put a non slip gripper on the bottom of the strap so it doesn't slip toward your neck.  I think this would fix the bunching of the padding that happens.  However, I loved this thing so much that I'm just going to buy a new one for my second child.   I know I will get my money's worth!  It saves my back and shoulders.

It is FANTASTIC!!! She is now 3 1/2 and I recently invested another $50 into the seat. I replaced the harness and the HUGS and was fortunate to find a new cover on clearance in a children's shop in Seattle. It now looks like brand new! We use it in a 2001 Toyota Tacoma double cab, a 1996 Chevy Suburban, and a 2003 BMW X5. In the Toyota and the BMW to get proper fit we have to remove the head rests. NO PROBLEM! As for the wieght, I am ok with having to lug a heavy seat if it means my child is as best protected as she can be. When you get the seat into whatever car you want it in, my recommendation is to literally climb into the seat with one knee pushing as much of your weight into the seat as possible. We do this when installing ours and it doesn't move a millimeter...... Our daughter is always comfortable in the big cushy seat, doesn't slump when she falls asleep, can't escape from it, and I never deal with twisted straps! Well worth the money, the *inconvenience* of the weight and size. Crazy that people would spend the money on this knowing it is the safest seat and then just because it is heavy put your child in a piece of junk in another car.

Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets.  He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old.  I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security.  He was never able to sleep without being in it.  He is now 30 months old and still won't go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack.  We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it.  That is how much he loves his sleep sack.  It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son,United States,NJ

B000ALBO36,Microfleece SleepSack &#45; Blue &#40;XL&#41;: Baby,baby,11 of 11,5.0,Wonderful!,"January 17, 2006",Grass Tiger,"Wadsworth, IL United States","These are wonderful! My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms.While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe. I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow.I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one.Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby. We've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally. We've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face. So after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks from day one",United States,IL

Little did I know, I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it's warming capabilities. After a few months under their belt, babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night, so blankets are useless (and dangerous).  So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm, even after the risk of SIDS passed. They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months, and they're generous in size, so they are not outgrown easily. I only wish I'd purchased them in yellow or white, in case my next baby is the opposite sex",Eire,Baile Átha Cliath

His is almost 7 weeks old and he still sleeps in it. It is so wonderful I take it to the daycare everyday and we put it in the play pen where he sleeps. It has been on day and overnight trip to grandma's house and he sleeps so wonderful because it is his bed.This item is very easy to travel with. This was the best item I bought. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was this. The actual bed has two layers that are not attached. When both layers are put in like they are suppose to be the baby sleeps at an inclined position. After about two weeks our son started wiggling and could wiggle all the way to the bottom where there were no side protectors and he could fall out. The way I fixed this is to pull the bottom layer down a little so he was not inclined and laid flay and that fixed the problem of him wiggling out.

The basket is decent size for this size of stroller(will fit small purse or diaper bag). It folds very nicely and has the handle on the side for carrying.  Another thing I like about it is that the canopy is hugh and covers my daughter completely. I love the fact that it comes with all the accessories too!

B000BDBBKY,SafeSeat Infant Car Seat - Roxy: Baby,baby,26 of 27,5.0,Love it.....but it's got a few easily solved issues,"May 26, 2006",GracoFanatic,"Ann Arbor, MI","I bought my 7month old daughter the nicest model of the infant safe seat(it's the central park pattern)about a month ago. Before I dared buy any kind of car seat for my daughter again I made sure that I read over every parent review I could find(So I thank those who have reviewed this before me, they were a big help). I found a few complaints that I had about about this carseat myself after testing it out in the stores. I'll post a few possible solutions that I've found. Complaint #1: It's too big to fit on top of shopping carts.    I don't like it, but apparrently you're not even supposed to put carseat/carriers on shopping carts. It throws off the balance of the cart and can cause the cart to tip over super easy from what I've heard. I think Graco actually makes them so that they don't fit for that reason.Complaint #2: The metallic or nylon-like fabric is uncomfortable for baby   My daughter hated the metallic and nylon fabric when I tried her into them in the store so we bought a pattern that didn't have it(Central Park). You can check gracobaby.com to see other patterns that don't have it. Thats where we found ours.Complaint #3: The waist of the belts are at an angle leaving marks on the babys' thighs.   My daughter got marks the first time she wore a sunsuit in it but now I just pull the dress part down between her skin and the belts. The angle though is so that the waist belts will sit at the pelvis(or as close as possible on a newborn), which is the safest and the ideal place for them to sit on the baby.Complant #4: Its' too big to fit most cars   I thought for sure it wouldn't fit in our car especially because our Snug Ride barely squeezed in the backseat. But oddly enough this thing fits better into our old beat up 1992 Chevy Lumina(the sedan not the minivan)than the snug ride did. And if you've ever seen those old cars you'd know that when the front seat(s) are pushed all the way back there's pretty much no room for ANY kind of rear facing carseat. With the Infant Safe Seat installed PROPERLY my husband can still put the front seats all the way back. And this thing still fits into cars better than ANY convertible carseat. Before deciding on the infant safe seat I had tried the Graco, Evenflo, Britax, and Eddie Bauer convertible seats into the car.Complaint #5: It's heavy and bulky.   It is bulky, but how else could it accomadate the higher weight and height limit. As for being heavy Graco says it only weighs 5 pounds more than the old(20lb, 26"")Snug Ride. In Babies 'R' Us I tried holding our old snug ride(26"",20lbs) and the infant safe seat in both hands to compare the weight and even switched hands, but couldn't tell a difference. I also tried my daughter in it and carried her around the store. I think because of the size it makes it easier to carry the bigger/heavier babies, because my 18lb 27"" daughter is a lot more difficult to carry in her now out-grown snug ride. And I like that even once I no longer carry her around in it I'll still have the convenience of a travel system beyond the first year if my daughter's sleeping. That's something that no other carrier (or convertible carseat) can offer.Complaint #6: It doesn't fit in the over-turned wooden highchairs   I made it a point to try the carrier in restauraunt high chairs when i got it. I have tried it at 4 different restauraunts and have not had any more trouble than i did with the snug ride. So far from what I've seen they've fit perfectly.Complaint #7: The stroller that matches the carseat is quite large   Most of the patterns only offer a Quattro Tour stroller to match it, however the 3 nicest patterns/models, Samba, G Collection, and Central Park also offer a matching MetroLite stroller, and the Fusion patter also offers a matching Mosaic stroller, however the Pierson pattern ONLY offers a matching Mosaic stroller. The Quattro Tour stroller is a FULL SIZE stroller so it is heavier, bulkier, and has more nifty features, than the MetroLite and Mosaic stollers. So keep that in mind when choosing a stroller.Complaint #8: It's too big for newborns.   The 3 nicest patterns/models of the infant safe seats come with infant head&body support, though it isn't the greatest and if it doesn't work for your baby then you can just buy the Kiddopottomus Snuzzler infant head&body support. It's actually reversible and made out of that super soft velboa material on one side and the other is soft woven fabric. I had to buy one for my daughter when she was born because she was only 6lbs 12.5oz. She was so small even her snug ride looked like it swallowed her up when I buckled her into it. I've actually seen other reviews recommending the Snuzzler for the newborns who're going in an infant safe seat.Complaint #9: The head support that the carrier comes with doesn't work   You even have to buy separate (double)head supports for the snug rides (even the ones that come with a single one) unless you buy one of the nicest snug ride models that comes with double head supports. The head support that comes with most Infant Safe Seats is made more for older napping babies. I recommend the Especially for Baby Double head supports if you don't get the Snuzzler because they're made of 100% jersey knit cotton, the back of the head supports are slightly padded, they're deeper than any other head supports I've seen, so they hold babys' head better, and you can get them in quite a few different colors to match your car seat",United States,MI
B000BDBBKY,SafeSeat Infant Car Seat - Roxy: Baby,baby,13 of 14,5.0,Great Car Seat BUT Too Large for our small SUV,"May 12, 2006",Colorado reader & parent,"Colorado Springs, CO","I gave the seat itself 5 stars - I guess our car gets 3 stars :)The seat is wonderful - easy to install, good LATCH fit, foot on it to level the seat out, nice lining. Unfortunately, we are going to have to return it and get another seat for our soon-due newborn!  It's too long (head to foot) to fit comfortably in our car.  We don't have center LATCH points, so it has to go behind a seat.  The car seat is so long, that once it is installed and at an appropriate level for a newborn, the seat in front of it has to be almost completely upright and pushed forward more than is comfortable for a 5'7"" person.   For reference, we have a 2003 Subaru Forester.Before you buy this seat, see if you can find a friend that has one...check it out in your car to make sure it fits!

B000A1AF8Q,Britax Boulevard Brownstone: Baby,baby,4 of 4,4.0,"Nice looking, child uncomfortable","February 7, 2007","Katherine ""CorgiMomToo""",NC,"My 3 year old (38 inches tall, 30 lbs) needed a new car seat since his younger brother was in need of the other convertables we have (an Alpha Omega Elite and an Evenflo Triumph V).  I did oooodles of research and this Boulevard seat looks very comfortable and I liked the height/weight limit. Only my son hates it. The issue is with the crotch buckle.  It's not that it's anymore further back than others, it's just that it's too short.  There needs to be an extra two inches of strap beneath it, like practically every other carseat on the market.  He grabs at his crotch (he doesn't wear diapers) and says ""ouch"" when I buckle it and/or refuses to get in the seat without a struggle.  The little pad thing they have attached doesn't appear to do all that much.I did try this rear-facing to see if my 8 month old (29 inches, 20 lbs) had any issue with comfort and he didn't appear too. It seemed fine for him.The latch straps, which shouldn't be twisted to attach, have to be twisted in order to attach to the seat in my minivan (there's only one way it fits).  I'm not impressed with that and will probably use the belt if we keep this carseat.Also, something that bugs me is the buckles that snap into the crotch buckle, only one of them actually ""snaps"" in, the other doesn't give that ""it's buckled"" snap like its partner no matter what I do. After all the Britax hype I've read, I really expected a little better.  I like the lever adjustment on the Alpha Omega Elite's headreast versus the knob on this one.While this carseat looks cushy and nice, and I'm sure safety wise it's top of the line, I think we're going to sell it and just get another Compass booster seat like I bought for our husband's car (my son LOVES that seat).  We've never had trouble getting my son to ride in a carseat until I bought this one and I can't wrestle a 3 year old several times a day into a car seat.  If you're buying this for an older child, you might want to have them try it out first to see if they find it comfortable",United States,NC

My only complaint is it's hard to get it centered/level in the back seat when it is rear facing (I have a 04 camry and my husband a 06 corolla). The tether wants to pull it to one side or the other.  We also had to pull out the back support pillow in order to get the latches to click without cutting off the circulation in our daughter's legs.  But the cover is very luxurious - more so than you can see from the picture.  I was holding out for the Shannon cover but Britax kept pushing the release date back, and I needed to get a seat quickly as my daughter was outgrowing her infant seat.

B000A1AF8Q,Britax Boulevard Brownstone: Baby,baby,13 of 13,5.0,Excellent seat worth the price!!,"November 13, 2006",Real mom,Wisconsin United States,"I did a TON of research before buying this seat, and we LOVED it so much we bought another! It is by far the easiest to use (I've used A LOT of car seats!) and has the best features. I really like that you don't have to take the seat out to adjust the harness height. The fact that this seat can be used forward facing up to 65lbs and 49"" is what sold me on it the most. I wish this seat had been around for my first child, who was off the charts for height, we had to put him in a booster seat at age 2 because he was too tall for any car seat we could find. The total side impact protection is another BIG selling point, no other seat has that! it is easy to install, rear and forward facing-I have used it in an explorer, escape and tahoe with no problems. People have said it is bulky, but it is not really any larger then other seats, just taller. Compare them side to side at the store and you will see :-) The seat is also very comfortable on long trips (8hrs with no complaints!). Another thing I really like about this seat is that the straps don't get twisted! We had a Alpha Omega and the straps were forever twisted and were such a pain! We have been using this seat for a year with no complaints what so ever. There are so many wonderful things about this seat I could go on all day.

B000A1AF8Q,Britax Boulevard Brownstone: Baby,baby,15 of 15,5.0,Love it!,"June 1, 2006",Ava's mom,Florida,"I did lots of research about which convertable car seat to buy. My daughter was 6 months old when we switched from her infant carrier; she is a big girl (about 19 lbs. @ 6 mos.) and she fits wonderfully in this seat! She looks SO comfortable and hasn't fussed once since we have put her in it, she used to fuss quite often in the carrier. This seat has plenty of room to grow and makes me feel safe with her riding in it, this price is on the high side, but how could you compromise the safety of the most wonderful thing you have?!I must abmit that the seat is quite bulky and probably wouldn't fit great in a small car, but I think it is perfect for our 4Runner. I have seen friends with other seats and I must admit that there is a definite difference in quality; Britax spared nothing! I wouldn't think of putting my daughter in anything else after owning this seat",Uruguay,Florida

The doctor prescribed several creams and the rash would disappear only to reappear within a day. I was losing my mind. I wound up making a special cream that my doctor had given me the recipe for. Unfortunately it didn't work and the battle of the diaper rash continued on.I tried all sorts of other creams (Weleda, Burt Bees, J&J, herbal salves...) and this all ended when I bought Boudreaux's Butt Paste! I put on one application and the rash was reduced to a slight pink area near the rectum. After the next application...Tada!! GONE! It has been 2.5 months ago and my daughter has not had a problem with diaper rash since. I have reccomended Boudreaux Butt Paste to all of my friends battling with diaper rash problems with their kids. They are all converted! Love the cream. As for the comment about not knowing the percentage of zinc oxide, it's right on the tube and in the information provided on the product page above. The cream contains 16%. Some children may have a reaction to the Peruvian Balsam. None of the babies that I know who are using this cream have. It's in the same family as vanilla and cinnamon and contains essential oils similar to those in citrus fruit peel.I suspect that if you are sensitive to these oils your child may be too.

It is very easy to manage and fits perfectly in my wife's trunk, taking up very little space. My only real complaint is the canopy. It is undersized and flimsy. The only way it blocks the sun is if it is directly overhead at noon. Otherwise, the canopy is pretty much useless because the sun is always in our little girls' eyes.

It folds up just as compact as a regular umbrella stroller yet it offers so much more.  The handle bars are cushioned and set higher up and out so your feet don't run into the wheels like other umbrella strollers.  The seat reclines just enough that baby can snooze comfortably.  My 11 month old daughter climbed right into it and fell asleep during our walk and slept for a while after.  The cargo bags are great for holding keys, cell phone and snacks so you don't have to concern yourself with a diaper bag on quick trips.  Even though the canopy isn't that large, it works well.  You can position it so the sun stays out of baby's eyes.  The wheels actually have suspension.  When I would roll my old umbrella stroller down the sidewalk and I would hit a bump, my baby would just about get whiplash.

They are good bottles and the nipples (silicone) work well for our son (age 3 mos). The only problem, and the reason I gave it four stars, is that the lid where you insert the nipple can warp if you boil it for sterilization, and then there can be major leakage around where the nipple should seal.
