Tina ""Ctina401""",Woonsocket,"I want to start by saying Fred Flare- shipped this product very fast!! And the transaction itself was very smooth. I do however, have extreme problems with the product itself. The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small ""note book"" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product",United States,RI

There are double stitches on the bag. the clip just above the calpack symbol, has come out. I suppose the ring which holds it has cracked. don't ask me, why I did not send it back... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag, which does not make sense to send it back. It has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap! The next time, I'm going to branded bags, it is worth the price I guess.On the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok! except for the defects on the front of the bag(mentioned above).if u r lucky, u could have got a better bag",United States,IL

The company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges.

MY BACK IS KILLING ME!,"December 30, 2006",Marye Eveland,"Mattoon, IL USA","Sorry to give such a bad review but I can't in good conscience give a better one. I did this workout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. I am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back. There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout. I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again. Additionally, when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen & the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball.

The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you).

They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?Among the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not!Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!  It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...That's not all the changes.....They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg.The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers.....The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches.Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.Do you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a ""specialist"" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical.I spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN""T.IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE ""OLD"" VERSION.SO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO ""FIX"" THEM????",United States,OH

The footbed/sole is not cork like true Birks, but some sort of composite (rigid). Birk straps are softer and Birk corkbeds are more cushiony.I wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so. Too bad because after that I knew I didn't like them. I tried on a pair of Birk Granada (the style this is based on) and immediately felt the difference. While these are about 30%-50% cheaper, I would have rather spent more on the original Birks. I think these won't hold up as long and don't offer the same comfort.

I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat",United States,CA

B000790YG4,Men's Wolverine® Moc Toe Work Boots Tan: Apparel,apparel,4 of 5,2.0,"Very comfortable, but very light for a work boot.","March 2, 2006",Ronald L. Russell,Pangaea,"This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of ""Leave It To Beaver"" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers. Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say ""Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains"". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest.Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected.After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return.  I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6"" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon. For further details, please see my review",United States,UT

B000F710ZC,Curvations 1076CU full figured strapless bra: Apparel,apparel,1 of 1,2.0,Disappointing Unfortunately,"July 11, 2006","Ms. M ""Bookworm""","Raleigh, nc",The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart.  I couldn't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.  Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims.  Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF.  I tried this bra on in a 38 DD.  I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support.  Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all.  That is not the effect I want when I go strapless.  Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety,United States,NC

Kuncl ""-pk""",Ok.,"I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).  I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.

The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies. And the velcro doesn't even stick. They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.

Munoz ""riverstone""","Houston, TX USA","I recieved this item yesterday.  Initaly I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the ""Aluminum"" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done.SincerlyRo",United States,TX

Miller ""madlinux.com""","FT Bragg, NC (SOF","I love that little white cross on red and normally expect a quality product when I buy them. I had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared.In two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched: One hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle. It would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon wasn't properly sealed/Melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven. The handle came about half-way separated from it before I stopped using it. This is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization, quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag. I would advise Victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price.

Chaib ""Not your mainstream mom""","Portland, OR USA","I just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns (sm), a robe (sm/m), and the two piece tank pj set (sm).  I'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy, it (and the other items) fits and stretches well while holding its shape.  I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too.The quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large (and engorging) breasts without the need for a bra.  It is strong but breathable, and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body.The length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees -  which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking, easing out of bed, hiking up to use the washroom, etc. without tearing the seams. As the description and the other review indicates, the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing.I'm very happy with the colors, design, and construction of all items.

B000J45DOU,Aimee Bra-less Nursing Nightgown: Apparel,apparel,13 of 13,4.0,"Well made, doesn't fit well while pregnant","January 13, 2007","S. Tallboy ""tigereyess""","Victoria, British Columbia Canada","I was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child.  I had seen the Aimee gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great.After purchasing the gown (was shipped via Fed Ex to Canada, which means I got dinged by Fedex's ""customs broker"" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.I purchased a size XL as I am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.The gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn't too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it's a very high slit, too high, I felt. The gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don't fault them for that, it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher.The bustline will be great when I'm nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you're a big girl, you must have big boobs.  Luckily, I'm handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.Overall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.  I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me, but only after I've taken in the seams at the shoudlers, and closed the side slit a bit",Canada,BC

As long as the price stays below $10, I will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear/work-out tshirt.As for the comment that these fit smaller than most, I didn't have that experience.

I somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way, my spirit...my soul is also being somthered. But if I am in a suituation where I have to have something on my feet, I reach for my ""Birks"". Now if you have never owned a pair, you are to still call them Birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them Birks. Birks are a sacred thing, and we can't just allow anyone to call them ""Birks"" now, can we? If we did, there would be total anarchy.I own three pairs of this particular model. They are all the same color and I get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same? Well, I would. I have my grubby pair that I wear when I'm at the beach and I don't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if I happen to go look in the tidepools and such, I have my casual pair that I wear to barbecues and church...yeah, I wear sandals to church...what about it? Jesus did...and then I have my nice pair that I wear to work and events where I don't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that I'm wearing sandals...she still is, but in my mind I'm justifying the fact because I'm wearing the ""nice ones"". In fact, my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it's appropriate to wear sandals and if it isn't, I really don't want to eat there. Dang elitists.I'm thinking of getting another pair. Will I throw out the oldest pair? No. You don't throw out the Mona Lisa cuz it's old, do you? It is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks. Are they pricey? Yeah, sure...a lot more pricey than those Fakenstocks you're wearing, but they'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer.So get a pair today...get two pairs...heck, get three pairs...and no, I am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way.I firmly believe that when your feet are happy, you're happy.

They take on every bone, every curve, every nitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.I love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months.

Believe me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice. Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this ""no-show."" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :) For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk. This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not ""cling"" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor. The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design. May I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier!

I've given them as gifts repeatedly.In effect, they give you ""drawers"" in your suitcase, and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers.  It's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else. The 18"" folder works well for womens' shirts, blouses, and slacks.  I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it.  If you want to carry more or fewer pieces, it's forgiving.  I use it for suit jackets too, folding them in across the width of the folder.I've used mine often over perhaps 8 years, and they still look like new.A standard-sized 21"" roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product), two full-sized Pack-It cubes, a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers, a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed).

I think they look better and are more comfortable then the standard old jocks with waist bands that are too big and can roll and pinch you. This is all you need to keep you in place. They don't cover any more than they need to. They're all you need when you jog (I don't think anyone actually wears them swimming anymore). The swimmer jock style in general is like that, regardless of the manufacturer. However, I'm giving it a 4 because I prefer jocks in non-cotton fabrics like nylon, polyester, and Coolmax. They are much softer and can whick better. Plus, there are now ones that look more modern and have funkier colors, such as ones by Calvin Klein and Baskit.

They have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot. They are shaped like a Birkenstock, but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed. The closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort. I wear them just about everyday to work. I chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because I work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea. The ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation. And, because Crocs float in water, they make great shoes for boating or kayaking. They drain well and dry out quickly, plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it. I know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time. They are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes. I wear them when I am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside.In short, the Crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes.

It rolls very well on the built-in wheels, and unlike it's smaller cousin the Oyster, this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle, e.g. going through narrow gates on a subway or similar, and 2) the built-in locks are not ""TSA"" locks, so in other words, they are useless for air flight.I would buy this suitcase again",United States,NC

This new pair was made in China.  They have changed...some for the good and some for the bad.  There is now more toe room, which I like. However, both heel pads were ill fitted and loose. I had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue. I'm starting to really break them in now and I think I'll love them for years to come. They provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm. Buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff, and will take time to break in.  When I first get them, I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit. If you try to wear them too long when you first get them, they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet.

However, there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process.  I haven't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in. I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged.  The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded.  I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable. Overall, for the price I'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase",United States,WA

B000LSGSPW,The Firm Sculpting Ball: Apparel,apparel,10 of 10,5.0,A Keeper!,"September 29, 2006","S. Giles ""Fitness Junkie""",Rural Georgia,"As an advanced exerciser, I am always looking for a new, innovative challenge. The Firm Body Sculpting Ball workout provides just that. This workout comes with a sculpting ball, which is available in three weights (four, six or eight pounds). I used the eight pound variety, and by the time we got to the ab work, I was ready to put the ball away! My arms really got a workout, as did my core. There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you, over your head, and move it diagonally across your body. I could really feel it in my core after the workout. Once we completed several segments of standing work, including grapevine, squats, and lunges, we go to the floor for bridge work and abs. You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work, which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches, which is difficult with such a heavy ball. Afterwards is a short cool down, which I thought could have been longer. Tina leads, and she is very fit and quite personable. She cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way. As with all the new Firm releases, the background is sterile and boring. There are four background exercisers, with Allison showing beginner moves. Allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. The music is nice and non-intrusive. Beginners will enjoy this workout. It isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout. Unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength, I would not recommend the eight pound ball. You could injure yourself if you go to heavy. In fact, I was wishing I had another, lighter ball for the floor work. I have all eight new workouts, and I've done three so far. Of those, I liked this one the best. I felt I got a good workout, but I wish it were longer. The entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. Another 15 minutes would have been great, although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer.  Overall, I give this workout high marks. It's definitely a keeper",United States,GA

B000FFTH0O,Deluxe Evaporative Cooling Vest (1 vest): Apparel,apparel,11 of 11,5.0,Like having air conditioning on your bike,"July 18, 2006",Drew Commins,"Suwanee, GA USA","Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, GA to Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. After getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferrably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so I went online and ordered one.The particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluxe Evaporative Cooling Vest in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Mail. They offer several styles and colors, including some that have removable sleevesThe outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside, zippered pockets and a zipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want. The inner liner is blue and is 100% Nylon Taslan, a water repellant fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. Out of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose. Once the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner liner is water repellant, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner liner will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.The first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to evaporate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.Bottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather. They're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Wear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside.",United States,GA

Perhaps if I handwashed the bra instead of using a machine, it would last longer.

This one did both.  This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. The key is to get a propper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra.  If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bra size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding ""it all"" together.

For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive.  It's made out of soft, thin leather (so thin, actually, that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface).  That might affect the durability, but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down.  The illustration shows a large embossed crest, but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying ""Dopp"" at the bottom - a significant improvement, in my mind.  The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch, open on the top and one side, to hold your cash.    There's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry.  The only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket.  I don't know why they used such a low-class material there.  It's invisible from the outside, and not really offensive, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.  I debated knocking off a star for it, but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that I thought it deserved the full five stars.Overall, if you're disciplined about what you carry, you'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet.",United States,CA

I love these, my preferred brand and style. Your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item.I only buy these in black as I am a firm believer that underwear (men's especially) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it's time to change them  -- it's better to be left  wondering  what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background!These hold up well for the price.  Nothing lasts forever. The elastic band is usually the first to go (after many repeated washings) before the material gives out.  i.e. they will fall off before they rot off. Finally, so I can feel like I have done a complete job in reviewing these, I had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the Weggie test - and these shorts handled it well...  extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed.

B000145UKA,Le Mystere Tisha Bra - Full Figure Renaissance (9955): Apparel,apparel,32 of 32,4.0,Le Mystere is Le Manifique!,"September 15, 2005",C. Meyer,Colorado,"Not all bras are created equal.  But what makes it so special?  As a fuller figured female, let me explain the merits:1)Support - it does a great job. This bra does not sag over the course of the day.  Your figure looks just as great in the evening as when you put the bra on in the morning.2)Coverage - this gives the modest more coverage so people don't see what you don't want them to see.  For starters, the fabric is thicker than any bra that I have ever owned.  And no, this is  not a padded bra, the material is just thicker.  Since the material is thicker, it means that it is truly opaque.  Not even with the thinnest and whitest t-shirt will you be embarassed.3)Comfort - this bra is quite comfortable, especially considering that it is an underwire.  I have not experienced the sensation of  underwire digging in nor the straps gouging my shoulders.  But on occassion I do feel some pressure from one of the straps (hence the 4 star rating).Now there are a few things that may give you pause.1)Price - this bra averages $60-65 in department stores, not a cheap undergarment.2)Size - this bra is larger compared to other bras of the same size.  What I mean is that the bra has a defined shape... it does not lie flat as the cups are molded.  And there is more fabric that connects the cups together.  A good descriptive word is ""substantial"", but don't think bulky.  This bra does disappear under t-shirts giving you a beautiful form rather than a body marked by undergarment lines.This is an undergarment that I intend to buy again... and again... and again",United States,CO

With Long Sleeve Turf Gear shirts from Under Armour, I was hoping that the product would live up to the description.  A long sleeve shirt that is skin tight, yet allows your skin to breath?  Material that wicks sweat away from the skin?  Sounded almost too good to be true, but I took a chance anyways.So far I've used mine both hiking and cycling, with the latter getting so much use that I need to order more.  Despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on, it stretches and breathes amazingly well.  I was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used Amazon's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the Under Armour product (Fogdog) and ended up just fine.  Works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what I use mine for.  Bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well, and is very comfortable.

The cups are thick and smooth and the straps are study and comfortable. The liquid is ample but not noisy or lumpy.  The cup fabric is itchy at first, but a handwash in woolite will fix that.

It fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable.

I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Madden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however.I love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. They're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe.My only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top, and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter).

I freaked out thinking they had discontinued them because I thought they were made of Gore Windstopper and couldn't find any that said ""made with Gore Windstopper"" but actually it's Polarguard Windbloc.  In any case, when you freak out becuase you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing. These are totally windproof.  Extremely compact, I don't think you can make them any thinner than this.  Good price.  The only ""downside"" is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet.  This is true of any windproof glove so it's really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove.  These weigh nothing (probably about an ounce each) and so I pack two or three pairs if I know I'll be getting them wet. I wear these ice climbing, hiking, mountaineering, I have a pair I cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter, and I wear them skiing inside of my mittens. These really shine inside of mittens because if you have to do anything with your hands the mitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time.

Today I wore them out shopping, and my back started hurting before my feet did.  My one objection is this supposedly 'squishy' foot bed.  I don't know if my shoes were missing that part or what, but I found the sole to be hard and inflexible.  They were still _comfortable_ but it wasn't like putting your feet on pillows or anything.If you do prefer a squishier footbed, I recommend a thin insert, so as not to squish your toes.  I'm not sure if they would perform well for athletics--I'm going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out, but I want these in every color",United States,MD

I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.  I recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loosen it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME!I am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  As long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.  I strongly recommend this product",United States,OH
B000FK1ZW2,Bravado Lifestyle Microfiber Nursing Bra.: Apparel,apparel,2 of 2,5.0,Best nursing bra I've tried,"December 11, 2006",C. Pettis,"Minneapolis, MN","I've been pregnant or nursing for most of the last 4 years and I've tried a LOT of different nursing bras.  I got this one several months ago and absolutely love it.  I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain supportive over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one.  I am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching,lines, or that nasty ""spillover"" when it's been too long between feedings.  I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bra that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.  Basically, this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last",United States,MN

B000GTSHLE,Lily-Padz - Breast-Feeding: Apparel,apparel,3 of 3,5.0,A must have for every breastfeeding mom,"February 20, 2007",Jennifer Suarez,NY,"This is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra! I've been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them. When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks. I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt, they don't always absorb all the liquid, and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed!I have to admit, when I first saw them advertised I was skeptical. I didn't think they would stick, I didn't think they would stay in place, and I thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they'd leave a tacky residue on my breast. I hestitated for a couple of weeks, wanting to try them, but afraid that I'd spend all that money and end up disappointed. It was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night I decided I would risk it and order them. When they arrived I read all the instructions and was ready to try them out. Now this is the embarrassing part... in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using. For some reason I thought they meant take them out of the plastic container. I didn't realize that EACH lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic!  When I first tried to put them on I actually tried flipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out. (yes it was tough to do too!!) I was frustrated because they obviously didn't stick. I began to think that my fear of them not working was true. Once I realized my stupid mistake, I peeled them off the plastic and tried again. They stuck perfectly!! Try and avoid having the problem I did.. make sure you peel each of them off their little plastic domes. I was immediately surprised at how secure they felt. I knew right away that I would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off. My next fear was removing them. I carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off. I was surprised that even though they stuck securely, they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts. I was estatic! What a great product!!I have found after using them for about a month that there are pros and cons. However the pros greatly outweigh the cons. This is what I have found...PROS------1) Attaches securely2) Removes with VERY little or no pain3) No residue left behind on the breast. Baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed. 4) Protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads. (If you are feeling sore these are a HUGE help.)5) Secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bra. 6) Washable and reusable7) Invisible under snug fitting shirts. 8) When properly applied you will not leak9) Peace of mind 10) Quick drying. After cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to reapply them (even if they are a bit damp still). No need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up. One pair will work and will always be ready to use. CONS-------1) If not properly applied you might leak. You must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on. However, even if you leak - it won't get on your clothes. Instead it pools up around the nipple. It usually stays sealed. You just have to be sure to remove the pad, drain the liquid, rinse them and then reapply properly. One warning, if you have an air bubble and you leak A LOT it is possible for the pad to loosen and pop off spilling milk on you. This has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping. I leaked during the night, woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if I had leaked on the other. My milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off drenching me.2) If you own cats/dogs... keep them AWAY from the pads when you aren't wearing them. They attract fur like crazy. If they do get furry its OK because it does wash off. Its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort3) Takes a little more effort to reapply the pad in public (vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bra) but once you get the hang of it, it woudn't even make the con list anymore.4) I personally don't wear them every day. I'm one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little. I DO wear them every night, but during the day I'll occasionally wear my  cotton pads so my skin can breathe. I'm afraid that I'll end up with thrush or just pruney nipples if I wore them 24/7. I have no evidence to back up the claim - they may work just fine 24/7. I'd say I wear them 3-4 times a week during the day. I will NOT go a night without wearing them though because I hate wearing a bra to bed. As you can see the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit. The cons shouldn't be enough to keep you from trying them yourself. Even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost. If you are like me and you are skeptical - don't be. These really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try. Every breastfeeding mother should own a pair and I think they would make a WONDERFUL and unique baby shower gift!

B000F5M120,'Storia' Italian Leather Messenger Bag: Apparel,apparel,8 of 8,5.0,Awesome bag!,"August 6, 2006",A. Larrimore,"Gray, GA","This is truly a beautiful bag!  I got the classic dark leather, which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures.  The leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag's character.  The leather is thicker than I expected; while it is by no means stiff, it is not ultra-soft, ultra-thin butter leather.  This is leather that will age well and last for many, many years.  The zippers are matte silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather, they'll be durable.  (The other hardware is the same type of matte/antiqued silver.)  The bag is lined with a heavy khaki twill that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap.  The cotton strap not only adds to the bag's uniqueness, it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over. (I wear it across my chest like a messenger bag.) Inside there are two small pockets on the divider separating the two sections of the bag.  One is gusseted and works well for a cell phone (or items of a similar size) and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards; I would have really liked for my iPod to snuggle in that second pocket but something that thick won't fit.  The internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook, file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags I've tried because they were sized for laptops. I actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my junk and the ubiquitous book. On the outside, each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it.  This creates 2 tall, thin pockets where I keep pens; it would have been nice if one side didn't have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items, but that's not a problem for me.  The entire back side of the bag is another zippered pocket.  On the front flap is a small zippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag.  The magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong.  There are 2 magnets in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you don't have to worry about lining up magnets to close the bag.  I've had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments.  Though the bag is pricey, it is obviously crafted with care from high-quality materials.  It also has a very distinctive look.  I am very happy with this purchase and have already added another Diongini bag to my Amazon Wish List",Canada,ON

B0000867DC,Goddess Cotton Soft Cup Nursing Bra: Apparel,apparel,6 of 6,5.0,Best Choice!,"October 16, 2006",PsyD Student,"Philadelphia, PA","I am technically a 32JJ (per some lingerie store lady), but have worn 34 DD and DDD since high school (I'm 27 now) and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra (33 weeks pregnant today). I tried the ""Medela Seamless Underwire Full Fit Nursing Bra"" in a 34G and 34H. This one is the most supportive, but is an underwire (which after 8 hours, I can't wait to take off - and I've always been a committed underwire wearer) and the H cup fits, but I'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk REALLy comes in. I also tried the ""Fancee Free Foam Support Soft Cup Nursing Bra,"" which I also got in a 34G and 34H is not the most supportive, but is comfortable (i wear this one to bed, around the house, etc.).So, regarding the Goddess bra - I just got a 34G and yes, the cups are a little big, which I'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they aren't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts. Not to mention, the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple (I've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield, so it allows for room for that so-not-inconspicuous item to be). My favorite part is the back portion, which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others. It is also pretty supportive, maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the Medela - but steps above the Fancee Free. I will likely buy one more G and an H in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing bras because I finally found what I'm looking for. I'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in.This bra really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first review I was ever compelled to write. Hope you find the same success with this bra, too. Good Luck",United States,PA

The Detroit Tigers have just defeated the New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series.   People counted the Tigers out.  Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into Comerica Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Nope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  No one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Granderson, Ivan Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Kenny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Jim Leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.  The Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fans.  TV stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Proof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.  The celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Jim Leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.  This Vintage Crest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New York City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.  The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over.  Long live the Tigers.  Make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006.  You need to wear Orange if you live in the Detroit area. ",United States,IL

I was very impressed with the customer service end as that is always important when dealing with a seller or vendor after the initial purchase has been made.  The glasses are great.  Though thought of as some as ""80's"" ""Retro"" or what have you, Aviator sunglasses are like Chuck Taylor Converse shoes, like cowboy hats, like your favorite solid color T-shirt.  Its Americana, Classic, and Cool, which is what makes it buck the trend and stand the test of time.  I love my new shades.  They also come in a great hard-case so you can stow them anywhere and not worry about them getting damaged.  Beyond that even, why pay over 100 dollars for a pair of ""name brand"" sunglasses that are made of plastic when you can get something with sturdier, more durable metal frames?  Even beyond that, the UV rating on these is actually not any lower than anything else I've ever worn, solidifying the fact that not only are you getting what you pay for here, but if your not buying here and paying more elsewhere, you are most likely wasting your money.

After joining the military, traveling to nearly 50 different countries, in sleet, snow, and boiling deserts in the Middle East, this same pair of shoes still look great today, 20 years later, albeit scuffed up. Indeed, last week I had a casual business meeting; with a little spit, elbow grease, and an old towel I used to dry off my dog, they cleaned up quite nicely and worked well with my Docker khaki's. They're exceptionally comfortable, timeless, and well worth the price.  How many 20yr old pair of shoes do you own?  That's like what, $5/yr?The style colour conscience among you might want to consider another pair -- in black.  They're that good, like an old friend, reliable, stylish, and right there with you to conquer life's many challenges.I highly recommend them.-josef",Japan,Kanto

Even beyond that, the UV rating on these is actually not any lower than anything else I've ever worn, solidifying the fact that not only are you getting what you pay for here, but if your not buying here and paying more elsewhere, you are most likely wasting your money.

Richards,"Beverly Hills, MI","Best 50 bucks I've ever spent. I have a valet job and work outside all winter, I wear these things every day under a pair of thin Dockers and they are fantastic. I'm a bigger guy, and the compression gear tops don't work well with my big gut, these are just right for my lower body type. If you're a size 38-40 waist like me, go with the XXL, it's just the right size. Combined with the Under Armour Driver Mock (actually a golf item) my base layer is perfect, I never get cold. I recently wore the same combination skiing, and the leggings were perfect under my snow pants. Just pull them up to the top of the sock with a little overlap and no moisture accumulates against your body whatsoever, a very important element of staying warm and safe when it's cold out. All of Under Armour's products I have tried do a great job of this moisture transportation away from your skin and I'll never wear cotton or other long underwear again. Do yourself a favor and try these out, they are the new gold standard in my book",United States,MI
B00029BKAI,Under Armour Men's ColdGear Action Leggings: Apparel,apparel,10 of 10,5.0,Make great running tights and more!,"December 18, 2005","Greg ""Arathald""",Illinois,"These are probably one of my favorite articles of clothing. I am a frequent (normally 5+ times a week) endurance runner, and I have found these to be a great addition to my gym bag. Whenever it's too chilly to wear shorts, I'll pull on my Underarmour coldgear leggings and throw my shorts on top of them. Thay keep my legs nice and warm without overheating them.I also tend to use these as a base layer under everything from jeans to my dress pants whenever it's cold out. Again, they keep my legs warm , but not too warm.I also like the fit of these leggings. They are tight around the legs, providing good muscle support and compression (good for reducing injuries and soreness), without being too uncomfortable in the crotch and rear (provided you don't wear anything under them -- yes, they are supposed to be worn as underwear). They also have what feels like a synthetic microsuede interior, which just ads to the overall comfort level.          I have heard a few people complain that underarmour heat gear keeps them a bit too cold, especially when they don't wear anything on top. I like to be slightly cooler when running, so these work for me. If you can't stand being a bit on the cool side, you probably shouldn't leave any part of the tights uncovered (wear something over that completely covers them), but if you don't, yo won't be shivering either",United States,AR

It is only 3% Elastine, so there is a minimal stretch and it doesn't feel tight against my head, nor is it too loose to require constant adjusting. It sits comfortably, the polar fleece is what I would call a micro polar fleece - it has a small short pile and doesn't feel cheap.

But, this also means it is more prone to scratches and scuff marks, so be careful when wearing them (mine have small rough patches at the toes just after wearing them 2-3 times, but I walk a lot). They're really comfortable to wear throughout the day, but not too breathable, so wear some shoe liners with them. Overall, I really like Steve Madden shoes and these were a great buy.",United States,DC

The material is light and does not cling to the thighs. The basic design has the seams running up the cheeks of the bottom not up the centre. This prevents the boxer from clinging to the centre of the behind. The boxers are durable and remain wearable for many years. Note that the front flap can stay open after continuous use and should be pressed to retain that `closed' look. Color selection is somewhat minimal. A 3-pack usually has 2 of one color when there should be 3 different colors/patterns. Why Buy: As your `main' line of boxers - practical for everyday use.

But just in case you didn't know: the straps are only attached at the back of the slipper; So you have to sew them into the front- I'm assuming for proper fit; This is a bit annoying- coupled with the fact that there is no loop or area of fabric to sew them into without having to see your handy work through the front(no good if your terrible at sewing like me); And they soil easily;This should be expected of course(especially if they are white). Still, as my title suggests,they earn 5 stars and more because they truly are that comfortable; Especially if your house is carpeted; I can't well explain why, because the shoes really have no padding; But they hug your feet and support your arch to an extent (I'm assuming these would not be as comfortable for flat footed people).The price is great and, if you are into ballet, what do you have to loose",United States,TX

Though this has been somewhat jokingly christened 'the bedtime slipper,' for looseness off the foot, the line on working feet is very visible, especially after repeated use.  Where Bloch and Capezio tend to require multiple fittings and testing of different styles- especially through mail order- Sansha styles, as long as they are purchased in the correct approximate widths and lengths, will mold to individual feet and stand for years with good care.  The only reservation I have about these shoes is the leather soles' capacity for holding onto everything they pass over for an extended period of time.  If you dance in a meticulous studio, this is not an issue, but where a stray drop of soda or Gatorade is occassionally spilt, you may want to scuff the soles once a week.  Washing does not seem to clean the leather as well as the canvas, and eventual buildup will impede turns",United States,NY

These undershirts are made of extremely soft cotton that is just slightly thinner than your average undershirt from Hanes or the likes. The cotton is amazing - these shirts seem to last forever, and after about three washes they feel like they were made to a mold of your body. I don't know what is different about them, but unlike cheaper tee's, they come to fit you perfectly rather than just hanging flat down your sides like so many other undershirts.If you haven't worn these before, you don't know what you're missing out on. The comfortable fit means your underarms don't sweat at all because the material fits you perfectly rather than gaping open under your arms. I really can't describe what a difference these shirts make to my day-to-day comfort.The only complaint I have is that they are slightly hard to come by -- so once you're hooked you'll always want to have a few extras on hand.

B000281OSW,Wrangler Classic Fit Jean: Apparel,apparel,9 of 9,5.0,These are the best jeans money can buy,"October 14, 2004",Steven M. Balke Jr.,"Ypsilanti, MI USA","If you are like most people these days, we practically live in our jeans.  What we really want is a pair that 1) Feels good, 2) Looks good, 3) Lasts long, and 4) Isn't too expensive.  Finding all four of these traits in one pair of pants can be tricky, but it can be done.Wrangler has designed the perfect pair of jeans!  They offer a variety of cuts, sizes, and styles so that it is easy to find a pair that fits perfectly (which, incidentally, jeans that fit look much better than jeans that don't) even if you are going for the ""baggy, pants hanging at the knees"" look.  Regular, relaxed, angler or carpenter, all of the cuts and style feel great.  Also, they are really inexpensive and readily available at Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, or any nearby equivalent.I am really hard on my jeans.  I am constantly wearing holes in them, ripping them, setting them on fire, etc.  I have found no jeans that last as long as Wranglers do.  I have tried other department store brands like Levi, Old Navy or Dickies, which wear out quickly (some even disintegrate washing them!) and I have tried more upscale, even designer brand jeans like Evisu, True Religion or Dolce & Gabbana which don't hold up to the wear and tear of everyday life.  Wranglers have outlasted them all, and on top of that, they are still cheap enough to replace easily if something catastrophic does happen.One word of warning that really applies to all brands of jeans, however, is that the more bleached or stonewashed the jeans you buy are, the faster they are going to wear out.  If you are really looking for value, the dark dark blue jeans are the ones that will last the longest, and you may get, depending on how much you wear them, another six months to a year out of them.  The stonewashed is the ""in"" look, however, and they are still really good jeans even if they don't last as long.There may be other jeans out there in the world that are as good as Wranglers, but I've honestly stopped looking now that I've found these.  They do the job and I am happy to wear them 308 days a year",United States,MI

Comfortable and not apt to wrinkling for a bit as it says.  The sidebanding helps with slacks being typically smaller/tighter/less forgiving than jeans.  The olive and black colors look somewhat more professioanl than the rest.  The only caveat is that they aren't cuffed, so it doesn't look dressy- but it's dressy enough to go to work and not worry it if they get ruined.  At 25 bucks, it rivals old navy pricing, but without the infantile look or no stock issues they have.  Oh, and these suckers shipped in 2 days from Joseph Bank.

Unfortunately, I need to wear sandals for medical reasons and apparently no one (including Columbia) makes a water aerobics sandal.  I tried these because they sounded like they could handle exposure to water and were at a really good price.  They handle the water just fine, drying completely in about 8 hours and show no sign of falling apart.  The traction isn't as strong as I would like, but it's better than bare feet or having damaged toes from shoes.  Also, the sandals create more drag in the water than regular water aerobics shoes, making my feet cramp more than they probably would have.

B000H45AQ8,Ogio Locker Bag: Apparel,apparel,2 of 2,5.0,"At last, the perfect gym bag","February 13, 2007","Robin Wolfson ""Reliza""","Cameron Park, CA USA","My search for the perfect gym bag is like my search for the perfect hair drying, yoga mat, organizing products, garlic press (Zyliss) etc. Fortunately, my search for the perfect gym bag is officially over. The Ogio Locker Bag is brilliant and the inventor should get some sort of award. K.R.T. Seeley's review sums it up pretty well, but here are a few things to add. For one thing, the shoe area also nicely accommodates a hair dryer or curling iron. One of the reasons this matters is that it points up a critical advantage of the shelf separating the shoe area from the upper part of the bag: while the shelf is sturdy, it's also adjustable. It goes only low enough to allow for a pair of shoes, but it can also be raised to allow for other items. Next, while it's very nice that the front end panel has all these handy little pockets for things like shampoo, brush, and whatnot, actually including containers that fit the pockets shows a real consideration for their users. Another plus is the number of outside pockets, several of which are not only zippered but waterproof as well, for, say, wet bathing suits. Before I bought this bag, I called my gym and yes, I really did make them go measure the width of their lockers. The magic number was 12"". At 8"", the Ogio bag fits in with room to spare. For raqueteers (sports, not crime), there are several loops on one of the end panels for holding racquets and a couple of others I haven't quite figured out yet. For yogis and yoginis, yes, the adjustable strap on the end panel can accommodate a yoga mat, if it's not too thick. An outer side pocket nicely accomodates my workout journal (yes, I'm a fanatical record keeper), as well as my beloved NewGrips (just do a search on NewGrip) which are indispensable for rowing (notoriously hard on the hands) and weight-lifting (and about a billion other things for those of us with carpal tunnel, arthritis, or, in my case, both). Another outside pocket is perfect for a CD player and headphones. The only improvement I can imagine for this bag would be adjustable straps on the bottom to hold larger, rolled towels or mats. Unfortunately, even Title9 doesn't seem to carry that one anymore. In other words, this bag is the best on the market. It's a bit pricey but it's worth absolutely every cent. I suspect that quite a lot of my friends will be getting the Ogio for Christmas and birthdays and whatnot. Congrats, Ogio, and thank you very, very much",United States,CA

I go to the gym 4 times per week and often go directly from work so I needed a bag that would hold everything I needed to workout and clean-up afterwards.  The Ogio Locker Bag does it all:  it's got a special compartment for my gym shoes and a shelf to separate them from my towel and workout gear.  It fits perfectly in just about any gym's locker (I go to Bally's) and with its front-opening door, you can access everything you need while your bag is IN the locker! I love the fact that it comes with containers for my toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap) and also with a comb, brush, and mirror. To top it off, it's light-weight, sturdy, and even comes with a built-in vent so that your wet/sweaty clothes don't get too ripe! LOL! : )  I couldn't be happier with my purchase!  GET THIS BAG!!

B000J4FHDC,Brandon Thomas Women's Grommet Suede Shirt: Apparel,apparel,3 of 4,5.0,Looks Much Better In Person,"January 31, 2007","S. Giles ""Fitness Junkie""",Rural Georgia,"OK, I admit it. I was a bit skeptical about ordering this shirt because it looked kind of tacky in the photos. But since it was on a Friday sale, I ordered the Asian Pear color, which is really a light beige or tan (I thought it might be kind of greenish, but no). I'm 5'8"", 135 lbs, with broad shoulders and long arms. I ordered a medium. And I'm wearing it right now. The sleeves are plenty long enough, and there is a generous amount of 'give' in the shoulders. I'd say that this shirt almost runs true to size, although a medium certainly doesn't hug me like the medium-sized Brandon Thomas grommet jacket does. A large size in this shirt would have been far too big for me. I probably could have gotten away with a small, but I like this shirt being bit loose. I can wear a shirt underneath it without it being too snug.The quality of the shirt (which could really be used as a light jacket) is quite good. It isn't lined, but it is soft to the touch and warm. It snaps closed, so no loose buttons to worry with. I like it! It isn't tacky-looking in person, but it's definitely different. If it goes on sale again, I will buy another color",United States,GA

Shirley ""Laurie's Boomer Views""","fountain valley, ca United States","The ""Jockey Elance"" bikini cut panties are comfy and well made, without giving up cute and sexy.They are cut just right with full coverage in back(yes there are those of us that still require this),a nice semi-high cut leg, and the waist band fits just low enough to wear with moderately low waist pants. They are 100% combed cotton, feel soft and nice, and even the elastic waist band is cotton covered for extra added comfort.The 3-pack of black assorted I received contains 1 solid black pair and 2 pair that are a light green with a very pretty darker design of little flowers and box shapes.They still fit great even after laundering(the instructions say dry on medium but I used low).The price seemed just a little high but they are an excellent quality and have lasted through countless washings.This style may also be found at ""Bare Necessities""  The prices at this time are exactly the same at the 3 sites. What I usually do is check for what the deals are on the shipping charges(this will depend on how much you are spending with each merchant in total) and also, you may find a different variety of colors or patterns at each. Just type in Jockey Elance 3 pack Bikini. This one is style 1449(check editorial description on product page to make sure), and just judging from the reviews of the other styles, these are the best in quality and comfort.OOOOkay...so even though the world now knows what kind of underwear I wear, it's a product I thought worth a review.You NEED these!....Happy Shopping......Laurie",United States,CA

Mullaney ""kightlinger""","Atlanta, Georgia USA","Though I prefer flannel and cotton boxers, I needed silk boxers for a long hiking and camping trip. (Silk has great moisture-wicking and quick-drying properties.) Under nylon shorts, the Intimo silks managed to keep my Special Fun Area reasonably dry even while hiking in driving rain. When they did get wet, they dried much, much faster than cotton boxers do. They lasted a couple of months before falling apart - a pretty good show of durability, actually, given the amount of punishment they took. I had only two pair and I alternated them, often with a full week between washings. Obviously they got kinda crusty, but that couldn't be helped. Under the circumstances they held up well. I would recommend them.As for this boxer/brief/thong controversy, I believe a man should wear whatever type of underwear he finds most comfortable. If that means boxers, fine. If it means a thong, fine. What women consider stylish should be at the very bottom of a man's list of concerns. Women consider all kinds of ridiculous things stylish, such as hairless pets, square-toed shoes, pointy-toed shoes, the Monochromatic Look and the music of Andrea Bocelli",United States,GA

B0009WL3ZA,Bravado Maternity/Nursing Bra: Apparel,apparel,2 of 2,4.0,Best of the three brands I tried,"May 14, 2006","l. taylor ""parentof2""","Tucson, AZ United States","   The Bravado Maternity/Nursing bra is very comfortable for daytime wear, so I would highly recommend it if that is what you are looking for.  The way in which the bra opens and closes makes it very easy and comfortable, and it doesn't create strange lines under your clothes like some nursing bras do.  After the first few weeks of wearing this bra, I had no doubt that I had made the right purchase.     On the downside, as others have mentioned in their reviews, I did notice that as time went on the bra seemed somewhat less supportive.  Along the same lines, this bra bothered me to wear to bed, because my breasts always seem to fall out of it.  I know I was wearing the correct size, so maybe this was due to the low-cut criss cross shape of the bra.  Whatever the reason, I found it quite irritating and uncomfortable to wrestle with my breasts in the middle of the night!!  To be fair, I had the same problem with another(different brand)nursing bra also, so maybe this is just what happens when you try to sleep in bras.  Consequently, I ended up buying a sports type bra for sleeping.      Overall, because I only used this bra for daytime wear and I resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to wear breast pads with almost any nursing bra, I really liked the Bravado bra and would definitely recommend it.

Being a 3-in-1 jacket has several uses. First off, the jacket worn with both the fleece inner lining and the outer shell is very warm for use outside on frigid winter days and the shell semeed to be waterproof or water resistant because even after rolling around in the snow it wasn't drenched. The outer shell by itself provides some warmth and also the water resistant outside to put over something else, say for example the suit jacket I wore to work. Definately not for winter use by itself but a nice compliment to something else. The fleece on its own is what I liked. Very warm and comfortable and stylish looks, I would constantly wear it around town by itself on a cool fall evening when out with friends.

The front zipper compartment was perfect for the quart size zip lock bag you are now required to have for airport security, plus it held my book and snacks for easy access. The top straps allow it to be looped over the handle of my rolling suitcase. It is easy to lift and store in overhead compartments. I highly recommend this product",United States,UT

The telescoping handle pops up and collapses quickly & effortlessly. The bag also comes with a detachable shoulder strap which I removed because (1) my bag is always too heavy to carry on my shoulder and (2) when rolling, the shoulder strap often dragged on the airport floor which caused it to get dusty & dirty. Fortunately, this bag has two short handles which make it easy to lift when going up stairs or moving it to an overhead bin.I highly recommend this bag and at this new sale price I'm thinking about getting one for my personal laptop too",United States,AZ

These pretty French Knickers were the first of the bunch I tried -- and I absolutely loved `em!Over the years my hubby has always given me different kinds of lingerie, all of them mainly ethereal or low-cut, but nothing scandalous.  And I think we were both ready for a change.I immediately fell in love with the high-on-the-hips and almost bottomless look of these knickers - and how they made my legs look even longer!  The fabric was much sheerer than what I was expecting, but the visual effect was pretty close to what's seen in the photo. These were the first crotchless panties I'd ever tried.  And it felt different to expose so much of my cheeks in the back (as compared to other boy-cut shorts I had worn).   But it was definitely the feeling of openness in the front - that made me feel the sexiest!  I wore these to bed one evening along with a matching-color camisole on top.  And even though these knickers made me more accessible (which was wonderful during our warm up), I still removed them (out of habit) when things got more passionate!For more general usage, I could easily see myself wearing these under my dress or skirt - when dining out with my husband (as a tease).  But I'd probably want to consider getting a more thorough waxing first!   To finish up, I guess I had always thought of crotchless panties as being a little tasteless.  But these cute French Knickers - and the other items I received from Love Fifi - were as beautiful as they made me feel!  ",United States,CA

Thiel ""John T.""","Astoria, Queens, New York City","This is my necktie.  There are many like it but this one is mine.  If my necktie is wrinkled, I am wrinkled.  Without my necktie, I am merely smart casual.  [. . .]It's amazing that I've been a male all my life (hey, this is the 21st century), worn many a necktie, but outside of those electronic tie organizers with the lights and motors they sell in Sharper Image I have never even known what sort of way one might store their neckties except in a heap--which has been my method all the while.So now that I'm a business-MAN, I wear these strange things every day, and I have many, so the heap has gotten quite a lot larger than it used to be.  And now I'm doomed to neatness because I'm getting hitched--so I get to wear ties more often, but 'the pants' less.And there in the soft center of my American male mind--the wife being Japanese--I've got this idea: Why not put my neckties on a tie rack?!  Brilliant!!  It will be a pre-emptive strike in the neatness department--major husband points.But I don't want that dammed Sharper Image thing.  It's great as a gift but to tell the truth, it takes up more than its share of closet space and wouldn't be very becoming outside of the closet. This thing though, very nice.  Cedar, brass, hangs on the inside of the door.  It's exactly what I was imagining, and fortunately some other brilliant man out there thought of it too.I take one point away for all the tie racks out there though, because there surely could be something just as classic and simple, but better functioning.  Guess I'll have to work on that one.  For instance, this could have one hinged retaining piece of wood so the ties don't all come flying off the rack when you open the closet door too fast",United States,NY

B0006HTWQA,2(x)ist Men's Contrast No Show Brief: Apparel,apparel,7 of 7,4.0,"Very sexy... but let's be practical, too","December 9, 2005",Will,"Chicago, IL","Like all 2(x)ist underwear I own, this brief is made of superior materials and appears to be built to last. It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid. If you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period. For those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it. Clearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise pants and (2) make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low-rise pants. I found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthetics of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contours pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive. Practical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of ""expansion room"". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs. If you forsee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C? It is the same price (at review time) and the same materials but in a standard cut and features sexy contrast lines. I own it as well and you may read my review about it on its product page",United States,IL

I tried out at least 7 different shoes.  The Asics GT-2110 felt the most natural in terms of the amount of ""give"" it had during each step.  Many others had more cushion but they felt too stiff as I launched off my toes. Previously I'd run in the 2100 shoe and (just for the record) I was very willing change brands.  In fact, I was willing to spend a lot more money to protect my knees and ankles.

I have gotten a blister in the same place with both the 2100 and 2110 (just forward of my right arch), so I'm guessing it's my foot, not the shoe.

As a fan of retro 50's lingerie I love them both. They both have the same silky material that feels so slinky, but the Ravissant are not as sheer as the LN. Ravissants are  more plain jane quotidienne undies than the L.N., however I like to dress them up by wearing lace top stockings or even better a lacey garter belt under the panties as they are still sheer enough to be revealing.One small point is the sizing. I usually wear a size small in panties and the size 5 are a generous fit more like a medium. I like snug fitting panties, but not everyone does. Same great bargain as the LN and I wouldn't hesitate to try more vanity Fair lingerie",Canada,

It has feet that enable it to be fastened to a wood deck too, if necessary.  Comes with a nice black case with wheels and easy-to-carry handles.

However, when manufactures refuse to inform and the buyer with more than ""Wool and Nylon Blend?"" there is no mechanism to a consumer to make an informed choice or even purchase what they are looking for.Stretch nylon is certainly nice for form fit and ease when it comes to slipping your foot onto your sock and into your boot.

Compact doesn't mean tiny. It is probably one of the smaller of the name-brand standard size ones I've seen (Kenneth Cole, Perry Ellis, Swiss Army, Nautica, etc), but it is not a different size category. Just a different shape, slightly less deep, yet has a nice solid broad base (the bottom is of a solid material which doesn't collapse). It is definitely big enough for the average man's toiletries.I like it. It also doesn't have a lot of inside pockets. There is just one wallet-sized pouch inside which doesn't have its own zipper. Not a mesh. I'm not sure what it's big enough for - floss and lip balm? The rest of the inside is open and free. It has a water-proof lining and a wire with flaps to open the compartment wide (essential in a toiletries bag really). Well-crafted from what I can tell.The outside is a very handsome patterned leather. It looks aged without looking worn. It also smells of leather out of the box - so much nicer than the faux-leather travel kits. You won't mind having your clothes rub against it in your luggage.I have a slight quibble with the handle - it is not as easy to grab as in most kits. It's more of a loop than a handle.So those are the cons: not a lot of compartments inside, not huge. Pros: leather, opens very wide, looks good, durable",United States,NY

If you are looking for the 501 fit without the hassle of buttons, this may be the way to go.  The 505 is rather full in the seat and crotch (technically ""the rise"") and can look pretty baggy.  Though described as a ""slim fit"", the 512 is more of a moderate fit,  snug but not formfitting, much like the handsome 501.  Rather than slim fit, it really should be described as the 512 ""tapered leg"", because it has a pretty strong taper to the ankle, which means it will not fit over boots, unlike the 505 and the 501.  The only real downside of this jean is that comes in only one finish, a rather milquetoast medium stonewash.  Over time, however, it breaks in pretty nicely and looks good.",United States,DC

I work outdoors everyday and really need to keep all exposed areas covered. The Ear Grip works great!  Not only is it adjustable for any size head but it is worn around the back of the head so it isnt as noticeable as other options.  Since it is worn around the back of the head/neck it also keeps your neck warm too.  Compared to other ear muffs I have seen the Ear Grip wont make you look like a fairy.  There is no fluff/wild colors/fur here and you are still able to hear out of them.  They are made with a plastic loop that is covered with fabric.  The loop corresponds with your ear so the hole lines up with your ear and the fabric thats covering it is more than enough to keep you warm.

Ellis ""David Ellis""",San Diego,"I gave it 1 more star than hot swimmer because I consider the pilling to be very minor.  I have washed my shirt every week for a year and the pilling is barely noticeable. After a year the shirt looks great, I bought more because I have been a dull guy wearing the same black shirt every time I go to the gym.Oh yeah, a major reason for selecting this shirt is it hangs loose around the waist.  This is good because paunches are not emphasized.  The competition's shirts(Nike)  allow you to show off your ""cut"" abs, I don't have any, so this is a good shirt for me",United States,CA
B000BKYI2A,Under Armour Tech Tee Mens: Apparel,apparel,3 of 3,4.0,Looks Great and Very Comfortable for Workouts or Casual Wear,"February 14, 2007",Hotswimmer,"Irvine, CA","I am a huge fan of Under Armour's workout apparel, and in addition to owning several of these Tech T-shirts, also own several each of the Loose Gear shirts (0084) and the Heat Gear compression shirts (0039) - I've written reviews on those as well.The Tech T-shirt (0382) feels really good on your skin - like your favorite, most comfortable old cotton t-shirt. It looks just like cotton and has a matte finish - it's not shiny/silky like the Loose Gear shirts or Heat Gear compression shirts. It is very soft, comfortable and lightweight, and I love this shirt both for working out and casual wear. The shirt runs true to size (buy your regular T-shirt size and it will fit really well), and is the roomiest cut of the Under Armour shirts. I absolutely LOVE the raglan sleeves on the tech tee - one of the features that makes them so comfortable and gives them a little bit of a unique look.The tech tee has a small amount of a lycra-like fabric in with the polyester microfiber, which gives it quite a bit of stretch. I like this because the shirt doesn't bind if you're doing something that really requires you to reach or stretch - certain weight exercises, aerobics, yoga, etc. The shirt works the way it's supposed to, and wicks moisture from your skin for rapid evaporation.The tech tee is available in numerous colors (I have 6 of them) and in spite of the fact that the fabric is thin and lightweight, the shirts are very opaque. The shirts have a nice cut and look great over jeans or shorts - in addition to the gym, I often wear them out and around, or when working in the yard. They are super comfortable worn as an undershirt too, but are probably a little costly for that. Like all the Under Armour shirts, they have a self-material neck band, but it fits just right and says in place, even if you get sweaty - it doesn't sag like the cotton ones.While I have zero complaints about the tech tee, be aware that it is Under Armour's ""budget"" product, if there is such a thing. The material does start to pill after a few washings - this affects appearance slightly, but not performance or fit. Although I haven't worn out ANY of my Under Armour shirts yet, I'm going to venture that the tech t-shirt won't be quite as durable as their signature Loose Gear shirts and Heat Gear compression shirts, nor does it perform quite as well. On the other hand it, it's about 20% cheaper, so as with anything else, you get what you pay for.When stacked up against UA's other shirts, I'd say the tech tee is for you if:1) You like the look and feel of a soft, cotton t-shirt but want the wicking and performance of a microfiber shirt.2) You don't care for the shiny, silky, more synthetic look and feel of the Loose Gear shirts, or the tightness of the Heatgear compression shirt.3) You want a shirt that's a little roomier.4) You want a shirt with stretch in it.5) You want to save a little $$ but still wear an authentic UA logo shirt",United States,CA

Being large busted, but relatively small around (am normally a 32E, but am currently a 36E), it's very difficult to find bra's that provide adequate support, are comfortable, and that don't look like a granny-brasiere. Further, it's pretty much impossible to find a soft cup/non-underwire that does all of the above.This bra is supportive, comfortable, pretty (the lace in the cleavage really does look like a cami under tops) and your breasts don't look like 'uni-boob.'

It has nice lace on the top, which looks like a pretty camisole under clothes.Also, the 6 columns of hooks are fabulous!

This bra gives the support without sacrificing shape or comfort.  Some comfy nursing bras (Bravado and sleep bras) give you a ""uniboob"" look-not flattering under close-fitting shirts.

They do not have a built-in arch support (I do not like built-in arch supports so this was a plus for me).  They are washable which is another plus because in my opinion too many slippers marketed today are not washable and I will not purchase slippers that I cannot wash.  Even the sizing was appropriately done in my opinion, you should be able to order whatever slipper size you are comfortable with without concern.  The only drawback (and it can be a big drawback) is the plastic cords inserted into the product to keep them together:  one was inserted incorrectly with the result the plastic could not be totally removed.  Because of that I cannot wear the slippers.  The plastic was inserted through the bottom middle of the slipper and after removing the plastic we discovered a portion of it was coming up through the slipper bed and there was no way to remove it.  So, if you're looking for decent slippers these fulfill but the quality control with the plastic inserts might pose a problem.  Frustrating but the product itself is a five-star. ",United States,IL

It's beautifully lined and the cute dome buttons are unique. The color (Java for me) was exactly as pictured. The cut is excellent and very flattering to a fuller figure. The shoulder pads (not detachable) are somewhat annoying full, but nowhere near making anyone look like a football player.For $24.99, this jacket is definitely worth it -- you would be hard pressed to find a jacket of good quality (cashmere claim not withstanding) for this price anywhere -- at least not one that looks more expensive than $24.99!

Like any sandal, they are fun and easy to wear. Just recently I've noticed that the front part of the soles has worn down and they are smooth now. Also the foam bed has started to crack in several places, but for the price I'd say I've gotten reasonable use out of them.The bottle opener is a great conversation piece. Also rest assured, they do hold up to wear and tear. I was skeptical when I bought these how long they'd stay intact, but I can attest that they are still in and functional... kinda mangled, but still intact and functioning.Also, if you think you're just gonna swing your leg up and crack open a beer like Mr. Joe Cool, then think again. I remember when I first got these I was at a backyard house party while in San Diego. I was flirting with these two girls, talkin' my game and trying to be super cool. So I grab another beer, and while talking to them, I lift my foot and try to crack the bottle open. Well, between trying to keep my balance and get the lip of the cap in the opener, I apparently shook it up a bit. When I finally did open it, the resulting explosion of foam shot all over me and the two girls. Not cool.I would suggest taking the sandal off to use the bottle opener feature.All and all, a great shoe. Fun and easy to wear.Another tip: Make sure you wash these every so often! Stick 'em in the washing machine. I neglected to do this and developed a nasty case of athlete's foot from them. Just a heads up. Enjoy",United States,VA

Agne,"Vienna, VA USA","I currently own a black leather backpack handbag, but I wanted one for summer use.  For some reason the beautiful light brown reminds me of leather sandals and breezy dresses.  It is a bit smaller than my current purse, but in summer I carry less, just my wallet, cellphone, small address book, pen and a small paperback book.  The leather smells so good.  The strap is ample and the handle is convenient for carrying the backpack.  I wish the zippered compartment's lining was a light color, but at least it opens up to give you exposure to locate items that sometimes fall to the bottom of the purse. The hidden compartment mentioned in the description is very small and doesn't have much room for a lot of items.  The quality of the item is very good and worth the price, although the $18.40 for shipping was a bit more than I wanted to pay.  All in all a good deal",United States,VA

From another review: The fold-over flap isn't designed well. First of all, it gets in the way of the headphone jack, so that many times when I opened the flap, it pulled my headphones out of the headphone jack.The part about the headphones is beyond me. You can put the headphones in the jack two ways. you can completely close the case, and the foldover flap and then put the headphones in, like when youre not going to be changing songs alot. I do this when I am working out at the gym. The second way is to have the headphones inserted with the case on but with the fold over flap/screen protector, open. I do this in my car so if I want to change a song while driving the buttons are right there. I have never had the headphones pull out of the jack and ive had it over three months and i wear it everyday to the ymca.and then theres....Finally, and this is a real deal breaker, is the fact that you cannot plug in the adapter to the bottom of the player when the case is on. You have to pull the player out every time you want to sync or charge you player, which is a big hassle.this is also not true. i didnt think it would fit right either when i got this in the mail. but it does fit. you just can't button the case closed. i can use the adapter or my wall charger(which has the same size port as my zen, thank god) while this case is on my zen.and then...The case is to small for the player. When i tryed to put the player in the case it was a tight fit, when i finally got it in the case the bottom buttons on the player were being pushed down by the case. This case also adds a lot of bulk to the player as well and is very uncomfortable to use. Don't listen to anybody who thinks this product was great, they are lying.the case does seem tight but thats how you should want it. you don't want your zen shaking around in the case do you? this case does not press the buttons down. it does take some getting used because you have to press harder to get to the buttons. but the scroll pad is right there in the open so you don't have to worry about that.I have had this case since i bought my zen. i bought it on ebay for 10 bucks. yes it does seem to add some bulk to the zen but i like it. ive dropped it twice all ready while in this case and there is no damage. it actually seems to have some shock absorbtion due to its studriness/thickness. and people whining about the beltclip....the only time i put the zen with case in my pocket is at the gym. i put it in my pocket and the clip on the outside of my shorts. i am upside down when i do decline bench press and upside down when i do situps, it has never fallen out or even seemed like it was going to slide out of my pocket. if you care about your zen like i do this is probably the best case to get for it. best ive seen anyway. dont go for them cheap rubber/plastic covers(you know which ones i am talking about). Also on the inside of the cover/flap there is a ""secret"" slot where you can put money or an ID even. its sweet yes? high five!people seem to be knit-picking this thing in alot of the reviews i've read. buy this case, and learn how to use it before you get on here and roast it all right? ive had it as long as i have had my zen and it is great no matter what you are doing.",United States,IL

I decided on the iSkin, and I have been quite satisfied with my decision. I do remember, however, being a bit confused as to just how this case worked. So, to clarify for future buyers, the case is comprised of:-First, a thin, transparent silicone (rubber) sleeve. The sleeve covers most of the front and back, including a slightly thinner cover where the wheeel would be placed. This ensures that the wheel maintains its touch sensitivity while also being protected. The skin does not, however, cover the screen, and a portion of the back is also exposed to attach an optional belt clip. This sleeve can also come in various colors, but I used the clear one to highlight the natural color of my iPod. -Second, a hard, clear plastic front plate can be snapped on to the front of the iPod once it is placed in the silicone. This hard case does cover the screen, and all of the front of the iPod, except for a hole for the touch wheel. Once attached, the hard cover is firmly held in place. Put together, this case provides exceptional protection. The silicone is very thin, yet protects against ordinary dings and scratches. The hard plastic protects the front from impact, and the screen from scratches. The best part for me is that, even with both the silicone and the hard cover, the iPod Nano still retains its very thin size - the case is not bulky in the least. In conclusion, I highly recommend this case for anyone who purchases an iPod Nano. Protect your investment",United States,VA

The hard outer shell protects the screen very nicely and stays in place well.The only things I don't like is that you only get one of the hard outer/front pieces, two would be nice to have just in case something happened to the first so you wouldn't have to go and buy a whole new pack.

The one I have just happens to have a silkscreen on it, and after a year of constant use (for work) the silkscreen still looks great.

With constant washing over the last year, the Hanes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster.  Also, if you tend to perspire, these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100% cotton shirt would.  Also nice is that they don't shrink or wrinkle.  I wish I had known about these shirts years ago...

B00020BJEE,JanSport Elefunk Messenger Bag: Apparel,apparel,12 of 13,5.0,The perfect bag...for college students.,"August 13, 2006","Daniel and Crystal ""pookyandbaloo2""","Tualatin, Oregon, United States","After reading quite a few negative reviews for this bag, I thought I would write a review to clarify something. This is a messenger bag, not a backpack. A messenger bag was and is never meant to hold all the items a backpack can. So basically, if you're using this bag for school purposes, keep this in mind. This bag can hold items for possibly up to 3 classes. So while it's perfect for a college student who might have a class, then another class right after it. This bag would be horrible for a high school student, who might have to drag home texts for six classes.Of most messenger bags, the Elefunk bag is probably going to be your best choice, cause of its size and number of compartments. We have 3 of these bags, 2 of which are used for education, and the third is used as a utility/diaper family bag. For education, as I stated before, it's best for college students. The main compartment is spans out and can hold 2 college texts, binders, and study guides snug. Keyword there is snug, cause it's not big enough to carry more. Inside the main compartment is a little sleeve held tight by a velcro patch. I use this to keep my study guides from my texts. Okay, next comes the the front pocket attached to the main compartment. This compartment is big enough to fit my 12 inch iBook in a neopreen cover, or a 13 inch MacBook bare. Warning, if you place your MacBook in this pouch, careful how you toss this bag around, cause it offers no padding and is very unforgiving. Inside this front pouch is a zippered sleeve fine for putting loose change or maybe id cards or what not. Next to the zippered sleeve are two pouches for pens and pencils, even a TI calculator, that is if you're not planning on putting your notebook in that pouch. Don't worry though, cause attached to that pouch on the outside are two zippered compartments opposite one another to the front pouch. On one side I put my black leather data file, and on the other side, I put my TI-89 calculator. Then that leaves the flap, which is secured to the bag using strong plastic clips. On the front of the pouch is a zippered compartment. Which I pretty much can only use it to pack up a couple magazines to read, if I'm waiting between classes. You can also use it to pack up headphones or earbuds, to listen to you iPod or whatever. As for the shoulder strap, it's about as comfy as it's going to get. Keep in mind, you're lugging 20 to 30 pounds of books and supplies, it's not suppose to feel like a Chinese massage. But I can't complain.As for a family bag. Eh, I wouldn't suggest this to a newly mother who wants to go down to a mall. Cause stores will not let your take this bag in there. But if you're on a trip, or going on a flight, this bag is excellent. You can pack away all your babies needs, and other essentials.Anyway, I just didn't like seeing a product I use, and like, getting knocked, cause a couple people misjudged how to use it properly. Again, if you're taking more than 2 or 3 classes at a time, this bag isn't for you. But if you're a run of the mill college student, who takes a class or two at a time, then goes home. This bag is a must",United States,OR

It's built practical, looks good, and (having to guess) I'd say it's probably better suited for college use rather than high school.  For some odd reason being in college doesn't require as many books to be carried in one day as I see what high school students have to carry.If this bag was a dual set with each bag on opposite sides, it would seem to resemble the old-fashioned saddle bags (except it's not leather, is maybe a little bit larger in capacity, and has plenty of individual compartments and zippers).

Now this workout is good, not as intense as the TransFIRMer workouts that were just out. Don't get me wrong: I have the 6lb ball, and you use it for 90% of the workout. At the end, I was definately ready to put it down, so it did work me out.Pros: Different change of pace using the ball; lots of moves that strengthen your core; a fun and different stretch at the end using the ball; Tina Smalley is a precise leader that is easy to follow.Cons: I miss the old FIRM master instructors that were in all the other videos. Just Allie and Allison were in this one. They didn't even introduce the others. There was no changes in weight, which used to be the way to spot an ""ineffective workout"" according to the ""old"" FIRM tapes. And lastly, In my humble opinion, the ball is a little gimicky. A good 5lb weight held on the dumbell ends would work about the same.   Still worth giving it a shot for different days. You'll sweat, but you'll wonder, ""Is this REALLY the FIRM?",United States,SD

So when Levi's introduced this new fit, the Slim Straight, I purchased a pair and tried it out. The 514 has a very large range of sizes and trendy washes, and is usually on sale for a very reasonable price at $30.I recommend this fit for thin men, tall or short, who I think look best on. Men who aren't comfortable with wearing tight jeans shouldn't purchase this fit, because it is certainly figure revealing. It's slimmer around the thigh, unlike the Skinny 511 jeans, where it's much tighter around both the calf and the thigh. The waist is a low rise, which I find very comfortable while wearing, and the leg opening is a straight cut. The 514 shrinks slightly when washed and dried.I personally think this fit is better looking than the Skinny 511, which I believe is just a fad for now. The Skinny has a sort of tapered-mom-jean look to it, and I don't think anyone will agree that a guy looks good in that! I suggest you try these jeans out before buying them, and see how you like them. As for me, I like them so much, I think I'll be purchasing another pair in the future",United States,CA

The grooves provide good solid grip for your feet, and though it was a little slick at first, after I washed it and used it for a while it became nice and sticky.  But above all, the reason you are probably considering this mat rather than a cheap(er) one is... the beautiful pattern.  I selected the blue one, and I've gotten so many compliments.  More importantly, it makes me enjoy my workout even more.

B0000YTISQ,Nature Collection Yoga Mats: Apparel,apparel,49 of 53,5.0,Two Sides to All Yoga Mats; Know Which Side is Up,"March 22, 2005","L. Hawkins ""Laura Wilde""",USA,"Yoga mats come in three basic thicknesses. At 1/8"" this mat is of average thickness. Mats that are about half a thick as this one are good for travel or placing under a thicker mat to provide more traction. The thick mats (3/16"") are about 50% thicker than this one and are designed for those who need or want extra cushion. At 24"" x 68"" it's of average length and width.These mats are really beautiful! As a professional, I'm normally not concerned with the look of a mat; it's performance and ease of use are of primary concern. However, these mats are stunning! You'll definitely get oohs and aahs from your fellow yoga enthusiasts when you roll these out. The blue one looks like the ocean and the orange on looks like liquid lava! I especially love how the design goes all the way through the mat and isn't just 'printed' on one side. The design on your mat will last as long as your mat will. There are two sides to this and nearly all yoga mats. Look carefully at the 'bumps' on each side of the mat. The larger bumps are designed to face upwards to cushion your hands, feet, and knees during poses while keeping your body from dangerously slipping out of alignment. The smaller bumps are designed to face downwards to grip the floor and keep the yoga mat from sliding. Many mats have a label on one end with the name of the brand. This is typically, but not always, located on the 'up' side. The bumps will tell you for sure. This yoga mat will increase in softness and stickiness with use. (So do most mats.) They start out mildly sticky and increase in stickiness the more they are used. You will want to wash your mat when it first arrives so as to remove the thin film they get on their surface during the manufacturing process. Instructions for washing the mat are included. Once you've washed and dried your mat you're ready to begin! After using it for a while, if you find the mat decreasing in stickiness each time you pull it out, this is the typical sign that a light coating of dust or too much body sweat has accumulated on your mat and it needs a light hand washing with very diluted soap and water. After washing, roll your mat in a thick towel to squeeze out the excess water, otherwise it will take forever to dry in the air. Then, air dry your mat unrolled, inside, and away from sunlight. (Hanging over the shower bar works nicely.) When you first unroll your mat you will find one end to be a bit curled. Simply alternate the direction you roll your mat (top outside once, then bottom outside next) or the end you start from (curled end once, flat end next time) and you'll find it straightening out more or less over time. I recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them for you. I've worked in many studios and gyms over the years. Sometimes management has mats cleaned often, sometimes not. If you bring your own mat you always know where it's been. :o) Plus, owning your own mat may encourage you to begin valuable practice at home. For my students who have trouble with their knees in some of the poses requiring the body weight to rest on a knee, I recommend temporarily folding over one end of the mat to get double cushion under the knee while still leaving one layer under the rest of the body. This saves you having to haul more than one mat out each time you practice which can be discouraging especially to the beginner.",United States,

This fits all my essentials, including a water bottle (a thin one) and feels light as a feather.  I can't wait to use it for school and travel.I am 5' tall and the small size is perfect for me.

B000A5LX0G,AmeriBag Classic Microfiber Healthy Back Bag Tote S: Apparel,apparel,26 of 27,5.0,"Secure, comfortable, holds a lot - not just for ""bad back"" folks","June 5, 2006","bensmomma ""bensmomma""","Ann Arbor, Michigan","I recently purchased a small AmeriBag Healthy Back Bag in anticipation of a long summer trek through Europe.  I didn't think my backpack would be secure from pickpocketers, and I wanted something a little more ""grown up.""  Here are some reasons I am very happy with this purchase:1) Comfort.  My Healthy Back Bag is more comfortable than either a backpack or a large purse.  Its wide strap sets securely on my shoulder without a hand on it, and it adjusts easily so I can carry it across my chest.  You can put a lot in it and not feel the weight - you will not end up with your shoulder in knots at the end of the day.2) Security.  The zippered compartment openings fit neatly beneath my armpit; there are interior zipper pockets as well, so it's pretty hard to imagine someone's hand slipping into the bag without my knowing it.  The wide strap is reinforced so it would be hard to cut.3) Convenience.  This bag has supremely well-designed features.  On the outside, there is a flat zipper pocket (good for your subway pass) and a separate velcro pocket on one side, a velcro pocket with a flap on the other, and a small pocket suitable for (say) sunglass on the end. The main zipped compartment has a wide variety of open pockets (for perhaps a pen, a camera, a PDA or Ipod), including one conveniently placed sidways so you can easily get at it from when it's still on your shoulder.  That one is perfect for a cellphone.  There is a flat inside zipper pocket that serves me well as a wallet.4) Capacity.  I've got the small version of the bag, and it will still hold a wide variety of daily essentials: wallet, phone, camera, ipod, a paperback, a compact umbrella, and even perhaps a very light sweater.The biggest problem with these bags is figuring out which one you want - err on the small side (they are more comfortable), then choose whatever fabric and color suits your fancy.  You can even get them in a premium leather, but my microfibre one seems easy to clean and a good value.This is my favorite bag - I can easily see several decades in my future with a Healthy Back Bag under my arm.",United States,MI

Larson,"GA, USA","I have used this clothesline all over Europe and South America on multiple trips, and I love it.  No clothespins are needed, because you can attach your clothes inside the braid of the rubber.  It packs up into almost nothing and weighs almost nothing.You take one end of the clothesline, wrap it around something, such as a pipe or a bedpost, or even a doorknob, and loop it through itself.  You then take the other end of the clothesline, along with a small hook (you have to get one separately), and hook it to itself.  This can hold a lot of weight - I've had two pairs of wet jeans along with 2 pairs of wet shirts, socks, and underwear all on the line at the same time.  Sure, it'll sag, but it's no problem.Don't get any of the clotheslines that have suction cups on the end - what if all you have around is wood and concrete?  Then there'll be nothing to suction the cups to.  You can't really hang your clothes to dry in a bathtub when you share the bathroom with other people..",United States,GA

If you are inspected it is unlikely the TSA people will bother rooting around for the TSA tool, at least as far as my statistical data indicates.  If flying into the US from a foreign country, use the cheapest disposable lock you can find.  If flying outbound, if you tape a lock or a zip tie inside your luggage with a note for the TSA, they have, in my experience, resealed my luggage after inspection",United States,CA

The Riggs jeans are reinforced in all three areas.  Also, I am 6'7"" and weigh 260 lbs.  Needless to say, it is difficult to find clothes that fit.  I read about Wrangler's Riggs jeans in a magazine article about work clothing and decided to try them.   The jeans I bought were size 40x36.  I have been wearing them now for two months and have no complaints.  The cloth is thicker and hardier than normal jeans, something I found helpful when cutting trees for firewood.  The pockets are deeper (something I very much appreciate), and the build quality of the jeans is excellent - triple stitching in all the important areas.  I think the part that really tops the whole deal off is the price.  These jeans were priced at $27 with free shipping.  Excellent product, excellent price.  What more can I say",United States,VA

You've got a very decent amount of colour choices, and you can pick between a brass and silver buckle. I picked the silver & black combination, when it shipped it was more then I expected; for the same exact thing at a local mall you would pay twice as much and that's not considering tax. The only difference between this one and other belts of similar design that I've seen is that they all seem to have logos, either engraved or cut out. I don't enjoy sporting I giant logo on my waist. I much rather get what I want AND pay less for it. The buckle is not a design that opens and closes, rather you slip the belt through the buckle and tighten it by sliding a metal bar foward. If you close it tightly enough, it will hold a LOT of weight, far more then the open/slip belt through/close buckle on belt design. I carry a bunch of things on mine, including a heavy multi-tool, a knive, a phone, several pouches filled with a various manner of junk, a tape measure, and occasionally heavy construction tools. Granted the belt wasn't meant for this kind of weight but...normally after a few minutes my old buckle would just pop open from the weight...no such problem here.

As a buxom woman (36DDD), I'm cursed with ""wandering"" nipples, bra lines showing through shirts and sweaters, bossoms that ""swing low"" and other embarrassing problems. This bra is relatively comfortable generally speaking, and it is VERY comfortable compared to minimizers and other ""hold'em up and hold'em in place"" bras. Personally, I think the svelt look of the bra is gorgeous.  With a big chest, I've never been able to wear those lacy little bras from Victoria's Secret, so this is actually a big improvement over what my husband refers to as ""industrial strength"" bras like our grandmothers wear. I only give it four stars because the underwire is not comfortable if you sit for long periods of time at a desk like I do; it begins to ""dig in"" a bit right beneath the rib cage.  Overall, it's a great bra to (1) hide nipples, (2) provide your breasts with a wonderfully rounded shape, (3) hides bra lines (great t-shirt bra), and (4) show off your cleavage but not the bra itself (if you wear a low cut blouse). I think you'll like it; and remember, you tend to get what you pay for these days.  The days of $18 bras are far behind us",United States,GA

You have to understand that I hate shopping for bras, I never found the right one and always walk out of the store thinking that I should get a breast reduction. This bra is the one that Oprah wears and loves. Now it is my favourite thing. I have to agree with the other customers that it is not the prettiest bra if you are a bigger chested gal like my self, but you forget about that when you put a t-shirt or blouse on, because you really do look 10 pounds thinner around the waist and you chest is where it should be. If you are a bigger chested gal, I would suggest before buying this bra, if you are not too sure what size you are, go and get fitted at a proper store....a specialty store. Most stores only sell bras in the A-DD cup, that is why you should go to a specialty store, the sales women know a lot more",Canada,ON

I think the price is what has kept me from buying them and have always gotten sandals without reguard to who makes them as long as they were in the $20 range.  After my last pair fell apart I decided to spend the extra money for Birkenstocks.  I am glad I did.  You can tell how well made they are right out of the box.  They are extremely comfortable to wear, and the footbed is firm but soft.  The longer you wear them the more comfortable they get.  I like the birkibuc material better than leather as it seems to be more water resistant.  The arch is solid and in just the right spot for proper support.  The part where the strap is attached to the sole is seamless and very well done.  I am very happy about purchasing the sandals and I recommend them highly.  Your feet won't hurt wearing them all day like some sandals or flip flops.  One thing to watch out for, it says the size measures true but the first pair I ordered were much too big and I had to send them back for a smaller pair.  I used the conversion chart the seller has, but you may want to order a half or full size smaller than you normally would.  The ones I have now are size 41 and are supposed to be for size 8 US, but I am a true size 9 and these fit me with room to spare.       ",United States,

Sherwin,"Brewster, New York United States","Hanes makes an excellent white traditional brief for the gentlemen amongst us who just don't want to wear boxers. The relatively snug fit ensures that these briefs will not ""bunch up"" like loose fitting boxers so often do; and many men prefer these briefs for that reason alone.The briefs are easy to care for; they are essentially permanent press so any washer and dryer set will clean them well. They seem to last forever, too, which makes them an excellent value.If you can, try to get these without a tag in the rear so that you won't get an itch caused by the tag. However, even with a tag you usually don't feel any discomfort. I've worn 'em that way for years without a problem. The 100% cotton fibers of these briefs add to the comfort you'll feel, too. My only real caution--and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five--is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them. This may be true for some of us men even if Hanes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store's shelves. I personally would suggest washing them once or twice just to loosen the fit up ever so slightly. Another relatively minor concern is that the elasticity of the waistband eventually does wear out. At that point you do need to buy new briefs--but, then again, nothing lasts forever, right?Overall, gentlemen who want a close fitting brief that still gives them comfort will be very satisfied with these white men's briefs.

B000CRF8JY,Travelon 75 lb Luggage Scale w/Tape Measure: Apparel,apparel,18 of 18,2.0,Use with caution on heavy bags,"September 23, 2006","Amanda Richards ""Modest to the extreme""","Georgetown, Guyana","Theoretically speaking, this seems to be a handy little doo-dad/gizmo/thingamabob for the well-organized/obsessive-compulsive traveler, but please take note of the following pros and cons.Pros:1. It gives you a fairly accurate preview of the weight of your luggage (+/- a few ounces) saving you the irritation of arriving at the airline counter with over-heavy luggage, and having to repack and shuffle potentially embarrassing items around in full view of the other passengers.2. You can use the tape measure to verify that your carry-on luggage will fit in the overhead compartment, or under the seat.  This saves you from participating in the dreaded and ruthless shoving tournament of the skies, where people try to stuff bags the size of newborn elephants into the overhead lockers.Cons:1. It has the capacity to weigh suitcases up to 75 lbs, but when you're traveling alone, it's very awkward to lift a suitcase even half that weight with your arms extended (so that it doesn't touch your body) and still read the tiny numbers on the dial. 2. The handle is small and ""ergonometrically-challenged"", and people who can't lift a 50 lb suitcase with one outstretched hand will find it very difficult to get two hands in there.  Even if you do manage to get this far, you won't be able to hold it for long before the handle sinks deep into your palm, cutting you a new lifeline.3. You need to try to balance the suitcase by centering the hook on the suitcase handle, but if you lift too quickly, the hook slips to one side, causing possible grievous bodily harm as the suitcase comes down on your toe.4. Another hook problem - you can see that the hook is an open design. If you are lifting the suitcase, the hook can slip off on the way up, causing the suitcase to fall as in 3. above. Even worse, the momentum keeps your hand moving upwards, and not only can you give yourself a shiner or broken nose with the back of your hand, but the hook can swing up and jab you in the eye. (True story)You can use it on lighter luggage without too many problems, but then again, if your luggage is light you have no need to fear the scale - do you?  On the surface this sounds like a great travel gadget, but beware of the pitfalls.Amanda Richards, September 22, 200",Guyana,Demerara-Mahaica

I like that it has an ample storage pocket for extra batteries and SD cards, and I like the easy-open U-shaped zippers.  No corners to negotiate, and no top cover to flip up and hold out of the way while you butterfinger your camera in and out of the case.  Pretty weatherproof and shockproof, too.  It provides great protection for your camera.I got a little carried away and kept the USB cable for my camera in the accessory pocket along with two extra batteries and a media card.  And this actually worked for several months (!) before I broke the zipper.  I could have bought a differently designed replacement case locally--there are dozens and dozens of them--but none were anything like as suited to my needs and tastes as this little CaseLogic.  So I ordered another one from Amazon exactly like the one I ruined.If there's anything I'd change about the case, it would be to add a small hand strap.  But that's not been an issue for me.  If I want to carry it in my hand, I just slip a finger through the belt look and carry it that way.I've learned my lesson about storing the USB cable in the accessory pocket.

B000AI7DI4,Case Logic Small Nylon Camera Case: Apparel,apparel,9 of 10,5.0,"Versatile, durable, small bag","March 16, 2006","Mr. Roger H. Geyer ""outcast_searcher""","Lexington, KY USA","This case will (barely) hold my 5.1 MP Sony Cybershot digital camera in the large zippered pouch.  The small zippered pouch is nicely configured for holding extras like batteries, extra memory sticks, etc, with the padded pouch and a webbed rear wall with velcro to secure the webbing -- giving two practical accessory sections. The belt loop is well made, strong, well secured, and doesn't have velcro or snaps (which I hate, since I fear losing the camera that way), so this thing will stay on your belt, worry free. The zippers appear strong, and don't bind or act sticky. It feels light and fits comfortably to my side or back via my belt. It is reasonably attractive as such bags go, especailly for the low price.  The display cardboard it came mounted on (I bought mine at a discount store) said it had a lifetime warranty, and it looks like it was made with a LONG life in mind).  The padding appears sufficient all around to resist normal bumps, etc.  (though I would fear a drop on concrete). I actually bought this to hold my tiny memory stick based MP3 player, and related accessories (I already have a similar bag for my camera).  When my Creative Muvo player's el-cheapo case that came with the player cracked badly and I feared it breaking completely, I wanted a cheap, durable, reasonably sized case.   I really wasn't able to find ANYTHING made for such a player.  Then I looked for small camera bags, figuring if I could pop the earbuds in with the winder and a couple extra batteries, I was set.  Now this is what I carry my MP3 player in.  It is easy to carry 1 to 5 extra AAA batteries and the player and the earbuds and winder.  The player stays dry, padded, and secure.  The very versatile zipper (two zippered tabs to leave any zipper hole where you want, and as big or small as you want) for the large pouch makes it perfect to let the earbud cord peek out without fear of any rain getting in. I think if you have a SMALL digital camera OR a SMALL MP3 player, and care more about functionality, durability, and a VERY reasonable price than the latest fashion fad -- you can't go wrong here. The only three (small) drawbacks for tiny MP3 player use I can see are:1). I used a piece of bubble wrap to pad the player in the large pouch.  It was actually a bit big for the small pouch, and would flop around a lot in the big pouch. 2). Of course, you can't get to the player controls when it is secured in this case.  This doesn't bother me as I generally just turn it on, adjust the volume to the circumstances, pick the music I want, close the pouch, and enjoy my music.  IF however, you want to fiddle with the player controls a lot, you WON'T like this solution. 3).  Instead of a custom-made hole for the headphone/earbud cord, you need to use a zipper gap as described above. I see no practical harm, and in fact it makes where the ""virtual hole"" goes extremely versatile.  However, it may be a fashion ""disaster"" (which I couldn't care less about, personally).

The ""iSkin eVo3 Athletic Protective Case"" has a hard plastic see through cover that fits over the entire front of the iPod.  The silicon cover is soft (and sticky so it prevents sliding - especially if you remove the clip) and is easy to put on.

You use the click wheel and the slide on top through the silicon.It also looks pretty good.The only thing that takes some getting used to is the silicon over the click wheel.  It, like the click wheel was when I first got the iPod, takes some getting used to.  It's pretty thin and tends to buckle if you push hard.  (Don't worry, though.

Goonan ""www.meaningful-life.us""","Pleasanton, CA","I bought these socks on the strength of the other reviews.  I won't repeat what these reviewers said except to say that I agree they are the best white socks you can get.  However, I will add some additional information that they did not necessarily mention.These socks are obviously well made and fairly thick.  However, they are not too thick which is a concern that I had.  They are much thicker and softer than Gold Toes Cotton Crew socks, but you must also pay for this i.e. $9.00 vs. $15.00.  On the other hand, I estimate these socks will stand up to laundering better, last much longer and will stay up with repeated washing.The exact composition of these socks is:  84% combed cotton, 15% stretch nylon and 1% spandex.  The less expensive socks I reference above are 82% combed cotton, 17% stretch nylon and 1% spandex.  One would think this wouldn't make much difference in terms of durability, but there seems to be more weight and material overall in the higher quality socks.I have also had some experience with the WHITE COTTON CREW socks and while they are absorbent because of the high cotton content, I don't feel they held up to repeated washing well.  I also don't think they are much better than less expensively priced socks by other manufacturers.  However, the WHITE FLUFFIES are a quantum leap up and worth the extra money",United States,CA

It is very large. This may be a good thing to some as there is plenty of room for deposit receipts , register etc. For women it really isn't a big problem if they have a pocketbook with ample room. It isn't a ""feminine"" item by any means. It is designed more for men. Though it will take the room of a whole pocket to carry it. Being a woman myself, I really don't mind the fact that it isn't feminine looking. I don't plan on using it for fashion. I just want a checkbook cover that won't fall apart in a years time and one I can keep more than a few checks in. For my needs it is working out fine.

It has feet that enable it to be fastened to a wood deck too, if necessary.  Comes with a nice black case with wheels and easy-to-carry handles.  It's a little difficult to get the fabric folded up and packed into the case, though.  Other than that, it's perfect.  It's a buy. ",United States,IL

I've owned them in black leather, in dark gray suede, and in bright yellow suede. (The last of these turned some heads, but they were cool enough that--in a situation where some rough characters were afoot--nobody bothered me.) They are awesomely comfortable. My tour guide in Israel was stupefied by them when I demonstrated the following: flex your knee, raising your calf until parallel with the ground, keeping your foot perpendicular to the ground, and--even without having to clench your toes--the clog WILL NOT fall off. Eytan watched spellbound as I did this over and over. The secret? You'll notice that your foot gets slightly wider behind the metatarsal heads and then narrows again in both directions (phalangead AND calcad, as podiatrists might say). The Boston is so expertly crafted--and so balanced for an anatomically perfect foot--that the material will stretch just wide enough to admit those protuberant metatarsal heads, then spring back just tight enough to hold them in place. It was fun mesmerizing Eytan: he was so arrogant",United States,VA

As a long time 505 guy, I thought their must be a lower line of jeans of Levi's that they are releasing to big chain stores, saving their Regular Levi Name for Department stores.  Well, finally I broke down to look at a pair of these jeans when I say they were on sale. I was astonished, they are exactly the same jean, for an average of $10 less.  Look closely, the stitching is the same, even the position of the inside labels. The buttons and rivits are the same as well.  The main difference is that the Back Pockets don't have that little red Levi tag, and the ""V"" shaped decorative detail stich. Otherwise these are the same jeans. They fit just as well, and I think even better, but that may be because my wallet is a bit fuller fit after buying these. After 15 years of 505's, I have found a new favorite.  Seriously, check these out, you wont be dissapointed.  Even better, they do have a kids line, so for your growing kids you can get the same levi quality for less, nice when they grow out of jeans so fast.  If you are worried about where they are manufactured, I can tell you the last 20 pairs of Levi's I have had have been made in either mexico, Columbia, or somewhere in asia, so these being made in egypt is not a big deal, at least they grow cotton their.Note: button fly 501 people, they do not have a line of Signature button flys, so you have to stick to regular levi's.

The fit of the regular Levi's Strauss Signature is similar if not identical to the fit of the zipper fly 505, Levi Strauss's most popular model of blue jeans. The main difference is that there is less sewing detail on the rear pockets and on the side just below the waist, and no red tab on the rear pocket.  The finishes are mainstream stonewash in light, medium and dark.  If you can live with this limited choice of finishes you can save a few bucks by buying the Levi Strauss Signature jeans.

These are real tennis shoes, made for tennis. That means lightweight, durable, and good for walking. They're beautiful little things.Many people do not know the full history of these Italian leather babies, but those who do know are of the upper echelon. The Ellesse name is based on the initials, L.S., of its founder, Leonardo Servadio, an Italian tailor with an innovative approach to styling and manufacture. In 1959, Servadio created a revolutionary stretch ski pant which established Ellesse among the elite alpine social circles, making it the ultimate aspirational brand.The immense success of Ellesse in winter sports clothing provided a perfect passport to expand the brand and transfer the design philosophy into the equally prestigious world of tennis. In 1976, Servadio seized the opportunity to take the brand onto a worldwide stage and embarked on an aggressive sponsorship programme signing tennis legends such as Boris Becker, Chris Evert Lloyd and Guillermo Vilas.Ellesse became synonymous with tennis and skiing and as a testimony to the success of Ellesse in these highly competitive fields, the Ellesse logo, consisting of half a tennis ball combined with 2 ski tips, surmounting the company name, was created.I must also warn that there are a few pairs in this particular line that have a minor defect, in which there is one shoe where the sole comes loose. This can be fixed with a little rubber cement, but if you don't want to be bothered, just send it back and have it easily exchanged, with the shipping costs reimbursed back to you. Even with that small hassle, you can't beat the sharply reduced price featured here!My favorite pick is the White/Tan/Brown. Just be sure to keep the laces clean",United States,GA

B0001ZMD4A,The Stormbreaker: Apparel,apparel,6 of 7,5.0,Great Jacket!!  But Price Lowered After Ordering,"November 30, 2006",Queensporsche,"Seattle, Washington","I am a larger guy and needed a light windbreaker-type jacket with a hood that would also keep the rain off my head (that's Seattle for ya).  Since none of the local stores had these in stock I searched Amazon and found this one.  The jacket is of excellent quality and is better than I expected it to be.  It breaks the wind extremely well, and if you really need to bundle up there are velcro strips on the sleeve openings, draw strings around the waist and snaps that go over the zipper.  All in all this is an excellent wind breaker jacket.  It won't keep you warm in very cold weather, but it is one of the best light jackets I've ever owned.  When I placed my order on November 16, 2006 I chose 'standard shipping' and was promised a shipping date of Nov. 20 to Nov. 27.  I received the item on Nov. 27.  I can't say for sure whether I would have received it sooner had Thanksgiving day not fallen within that week, so I won't really complain about the receiving date.  My COMPLAINT with the order, however, is this:  From the time I placed my order to the time I received the jacket, the advertised sale price DROPPED by 25 percent, $10.00.  I ordered the jacket and paid $39.95 but by the time I got it, the price was $29.99.  This didn't seem right to me.  I've written to Turfer for a resolution but have not yet received one.  If this is resolved favorably, I'll edit this review.  Except for the price dispute, I highly recommend this jacket if you need a light windbreaker type jacket.  It will serve you very well.  Just make sure that you get the right price!! EDIT:  Still no response from Turfer on the price change, but Amazon's stated policy is that prices and availability may change without notice, so I guess it's buyer beware.  I notice that as of today the price on this item is still $29.99.  I've been using it for 2 months now and I must say it's a fantastic lightweight jacket.  I want to buy another one but I'm afraid the second I order it the price will drop to $19.99!!!",United States,WA

When I received my shoes I noticed the hole in the bottom and sides of the shoe and thought this was not a good idea.  But then I figured if it rains the insoles, along with my weight, would block any water from getting in the shoe.  Well I was wrong.  It had rained and the road was muddy so now a good pair of white socks have to be trashed.  The wet mud came through all the holes in the shoe including the insoles which also have holes in them.

B00070PG5C,Speedo Men's Shoreline Square Leg Bathing Suit: Apparel,apparel,2 of 3,4.0,Not for the insecure,"January 9, 2007",gengis01,"Fort Lee, NJ United States","I bought this swimsuit because the current style of baggy surfer shorts was extremely uncomfortable for swimming laps (OK, I admit that I was also inspired by the Bond movie, Casino Royale).  But I didn't want to go all out and get those tiny suits that Olympic swimmers and Europeans wear so this was a nice compromise.Remember that it's a snug, tight suit so if you normally wear a Medium pair of surfing trunks, you'll want a Large size here cause it will feel uncomfortably tight and make you feel VERY self-conscious when you step out of the changing room.Material is very good.  It stretches well, dries quickly.  The elastic in the waistband, however, is not attached so everytime you take off the suit, the waistband elastic gets all twisted around.  It's not difficulat to manually twist 'em back into shape --but it's still annoying.Because it's so snug, there are no pockets of any kind and no place to put your locker key.Overall, it's a good product.  But you better not be self-conscious about your body --this is the man's equivalent of a thong bikini (considering how modest men's --at least American men's-- swimwear has become).  I felt very self-conscious at first but since I only wore them to the gym to swim laps, I didn't care so much about how I looked and I really appreciated the fact that this was comfortable to swim in.  But now, after a year of dedicated working out, I'm starting to look GOOD and these swimtrunks really accentuate the broad shoulders and tight abs.  I even wear them around the house cause it drives my wife nuts (in a good way).  And now that James Bond wore something like these in Casino Royale, it won't be too weird for me to wear this to the beach this summer",United States,NJ

Would be great for cross country, because the treads are somewhat knobby. Not too knobby to use on the treadmill so I'd have to say they are a great all around running shoe and are A+ for outdoors/x-country or winter running.  The goretex weather proofing didn't make my feet too hot.  Probably an overkill if you don't plan to use them for running, the knobby tread can make you trip if you're just walking, etc.  I haven't used them in bad weather but I would imagine they would be great for running in rain/snow/ice conditions.

Sherwin,"Brewster, New York United States","Amazon notes that these socks are ""only made from the finest yarns."" They mean it, too! These socks keep your feet warm; and they are very well made and last forever. These athletic crew socks can be worn for athletic activities but of course they could be worn for everyday routine use as well. In addition, they are made from 85% Gold Toe's ""Ultrabrite"" acrylic and 15% stretch nylon. Amazon states that the acrylic gives these socks ""wickability"" but this word may be a typographical error; I could not find an entry for the word ""wickability"" in the dictionary. The price is right, too. These crew length socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is--almost--one size fits all. The reinforced heel and toe makes them last longer and they still feel very comfortable on my feet. The sock itself comes in white; but the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they could ""bunch up"" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature. Then they will remain just as comfortable as ever. I know mine do!Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get more than your money's worth. A good deal!SMILE",United States,NY

Be confident waring these!,"January 20, 2007","Eric W ""swimmer""","Washington DC, USA","The best Swim suit that I have ever seen in the USI strongly believe that this is the best Speedo suits that I have ever bought in this country. The swim suites being made of very soft and elastic fabric, it does not cause the itchiness on your waste, hips, and crotch, which usually happens when you put on small Speedos like this. The suits actually have only one inch cloth on the sides, you may move your legs in the water very easily, and it makes your swim performance far better than the other Speedos. Another good feature of this suit is that there are many variation of color. I own white, black and dark blue one. I personally do not recommend the one in white and very light color, since it become absolutely see-through when wet.I know there is one big concern when men wearing this suite. Here is my comment to someone who does not have confidence to wear them in swimming pool: To be frank, my friends told me that the suits are little revealing since those have high-leg cut and made of thin fabric. In fact, even in the darker colors, shape of your""manhood"" will be somewhat revealed especially when wet in these suits. (But not see-through) However, don't you think it always happens when you are in any Speedos as long you have the ""organ?"" it is absolutely more strange if that part was completely flat. In addition, any swimming suits have more or less this feature. If you are a person who thinks that is unfavorable, you may want to stop swimming in pool and do the other work outs. In other words, people might see you package occasionally since it has high leg cut and adhere to your body. However who cares, stares, and makes fun of it all the time when you are in swimming pool? The suites cover only essential part because it was made to swim fast, but absolutely not to reveal your manhood and pull attention from others. Don't you agree? I recommend you to try it at least once if you are swimmers who seriously want to swim fast. The price being around $20, it is affordable as the second swim ware. I realized that the actual size of the waist of this suite might be a little bigger than the jeans or pants. Therefore, you will feel more comfortable if you buy a one size smaller. Like myself, I usually ware jeans or pants in the size of 29. Therefore I chose 28 and perfectly fit me. The fabric being elastic, it stretches a bit. However, if you worry about the size, just buy the exact size. I love this suit and ware it all at least once a week. As other people wrote previously, the color fades relatively fast in pool water. Therefore, I would suggest you buy two pairs and wear it in turns. ",United States,DC

I have put these things to the test in EXTENDED hiking chores and come in at day's end with sore back, legs, etc - but feet feeling fine and ready for more.  Sounds like baloney but it's not.I cannot overstate how pleased I have been with mine.  Great traction and they show essentially no wear thus far.  It scares me to think what it will take to wear these things out.  I didn't buy them for looks, but I've had several compliments on them.Some additional observations -- There is essentially no break in period.  You can hit it hard with them right out of the box and they'll treat your feet well.  Although a slip-on, due to their substantial construction, they do not pull on all that easily.  You have to use the handy heel tab provided and give a pretty good tug.As they look kind of like a running shoe (the ""chameleon effect"" again) I gave them a go on a two mile jog.  BIG MISTAKE.  I might as well have been wearing steel-toe engineer boots.  These things have a substantial heel element concealed in the shoe and they felt like they weighed a ton.  They are not cross-trainers and are not suited as running shoe.  I fully recommend these for situations where one is on their feet all day and a casual/sports appearing shoe is appropriate.

On the one hand, no force on this earth could make these socks sag, which is good; on the other hand, they're a minor pain to get on.  I actually had to get hosiery advice from my wife (roll the top down, put your foot into the bottom part, and then unroll the sock up your leg), which is disturbing.More disturbing is feeling like I should be donning a tunic and heading off to a Ren Faire.

I was wary about this bag because it doesn't have padding/rigid structure to protect the computer but I rarely lug my computer around outside of going to the airport, to and from the car, to a friend's house, etc. This bag is perfect for short distances where I don't have to stand idle longer than 30 minutes (the strap isn't comfortable with a heavy load). But like I say, I'm not walking around with a heavy load for very long. Now! For the most awesome feature, once I'm in my hotel and my computer is on the desk where it will stay until time to go back to the airport, I have a stylish and simple all purpose canvas bag to put my book, scarf, notebook, or whatever. Try carrying around a typical laptop bag without looking like the laptop guy. Now that I have one, the benefits of having a slim multi-purpose bag far outweigh my desire for padding.This bag fits the bill for dual purposes. If you carry around your computer ALL the time you may want consider buying something with padding on the bottom and some rigidity. I wouldn't ever want to drop the bag with my notebook in it or I might need a new PC. But come on! Sub-$20 bucks!!! Great Deal.",United States,TN

Now, I wear an 11 narrow so I only paid 59 bucks for these and this fact does affect my review.I sold shoes for several years and learned what good shoes are and where they come from. Generally, Italian shoes are a safe bet but I tend to buy Swedish, Spanish or Brazilian because of the uniform quality. Let me tell you, Brazilian leather is some of the finest and rivals Spanish leather.These shoes arrived and I wore them to work the next day.  I chose the CHILI color which didn't disappoint right out of the box. Mimimal soreness which is a good sign and also very light creasing on the uppers which made me happy.  A minor gripe which is not aimed solely at Bostonian but does anyone welt their shoes anymore? Welting is usually the surest sign of quality and easy to discern. Welting is simply sewing through the sole of the shoe. It is faked often so beware of rubber welting.The heel is stacked on this shoe and  it seems a good laminate job. Stacking adds stability and oomph to a heel so always go for it when you can.The leathers on this shoe are very good for the price and display a nice patina and richness. Not quite top notch shoe leather but above-average for this range. The stitching is very nice with no defects on either shoe.The overall profile of this shoe is handsome and sleek -- just the way I like my oxfords. The finish is rich and deep. I received several compliments on them around the office which always helps!All in all, I have more expensive brown oxfords in my closet but these babies are just as comfortable and attractive not to mention cheaper.

I do some international travel and a travel wallet becomes very much necessary to carry my passport, air tickets, itinerary ...Why would I reccomend this travel wallet * Size - Many of the travel wallets in the market do not completely fit in a air ticket- this one does - withouth folding the air tickets/boarding pass. * Zippers - The previous travels wallets that I owned did not have any zippers, I have had incidence where my boarding pass had falled off and I did not even realize.  Zippers are a must when you are carrying documents.  Ofcourse it does make it painful to open them everytime.  But hey, which one would you prefer - losing your documents are a fews seconds to open the zippers  * PVC backing - The wallet comes with a firm PVC backing, so that it does not bend easily and wrinkle you documents  * Good looks and styling - With a swiss army logo and good quality material - people are sure to notice what you are carrying.  The wallet does not have to be made in leather, still its looks are very decent.Where the travel wallet loses a star ?  I wish if there was another dividing compartment in the wallet",United States,VA

The main difference is the stitching on the pouch and the cut.This coutour pouch brief is meant to (like most 2(x)ist underwear), show off your male assets.

I would suggest that brief as well, but you will lose out on the sexy contrast lines.If you seem to like this brief, may I suggest you shake things up a little a consider ordering the 2(x)ist Contrast No-Show Trunk 3133C?

The screen protector is a nice touch.The armband is not something I use with a device this hefty.  The belt clip is suspect- it's too flimsy for me to use and feel confident with.

B000JZDKWQ,Silicone Case for Creative Zen Vision M 30GB Deluxe Package Sillicon Skin Cover comes with Armband/Screen Protector / Belt Clip / Film Screen Protector / View Stand: Apparel,apparel,3 of 3,5.0,Best bundle by far,"March 10, 2007",C. Payne,"Fargo, ND","Well, after using my Creative Zen naked, with no covering at all; with the other popular leather cover; and with this sillicon cover/package, I can honestly say that, considering the price and what's included in this package, this is, by far, the best route to go when picking a case for your own Zen. The other main case, the leather one, looks nice, but for around $30, I expect a little more functionality. This cover is a few dollars cheaper, and for that, I would only expect a cover, as is included with the leather one. But, when you take into account the screen protector that's included (and which costs $15 by itself from other places), the stand on the back (which is, granted, mildly weak, but look at what it's holding up....if you watch your share of videos and movies on your Zen, as I do, the back-stand comes in very handy), and the other things, I would expect it to be more. So, don't let the cheap price deter you from getting this one, as it almost did me, thinking that it's poor quality. The sillicon tends to attract dust and lint, but it wipes or blows away easily, and is, really, the only thing that comes close to a downside. Get this case. You won't regret it",United States,ND

Do not miss this great price!Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials.What drew me to this particular pair was the bold graphic statement it makes with the contrast, specifically around the pouch area.  Believe me, it is truly a pouch.  A big one.  Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it.  The contrast lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this ""no-show.""  I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it.  Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :)For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show.  Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded.  But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear.  I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk.This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature.  My only complaint is that the leg openings (also contrast) do not ""cling"" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc.  But that is just minor.The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.I cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection",United States,IL

The wallet has 15 credit card slots (and you can carry more if you double up), and a window for your driver's license conveniently located on the checkbook flap. The zippered compartment is wide, and has two big open pockets for your bills, and papers; a credit card holder(that's part of the 15 counted) and a center zippered compartment. I am on my second Big Fat Wallet. It is the only wallet that fits all my stuff. I can go to the ATM and immediately put my cash in this wallet and zipper it up. I don't have to fumble trying to stuff it into slim pockets like other wallets I have owned. The new edition (which is the one pictured here) has an extra fastener so it can accomodate your wallet's growth, and stay closed. It also has a pocket under the front flap.  The only complaint is that the ID window that you could pull out out from the back pocket and then have it ""pop"" back doesn't do that anymore. Instead of a elastic band that attached the window to the wallet, Mundi substituted a plastic fastner..like the kind that stores use to hang price tags on clothes. All in all, for a leather wallet at this low price, you can't go wrong. Yes, the leather isn't glove soft or for that matter a high quality leather, but I'd rather not have a flashy expensive wallet.

Everything works. The leather is good quality - looks like calf. It is comfortable to wear on the back but also has a top strap to carry in one hand. That strap and the part of the armband that adjusts are an ordinary sort of nylon strap. I would have preferred all leather, but for this price (under $30) it is a quibbling point. Inside are places for your wallet, cell, PDA, lipstick, etc. On a brief shopping sortie, it may carry home all your purchases (of small things) and make you look good while doing it. After all, most people use those cheap nylon backpacks with the garish colors (or black, Yuk!) so you will stand out as having some class.Note that it is best to think of this as the equivalent of a large handbag rather than a backpack large enough for an extended camping trip.

Sherwin,"Brewster, New York United States","Gold Toe makes an excellent sock and their ""Men's Canterbury Dress Sock"" is no exception. The socks are remarkably comfortable. They are not thick; and although they are a bit thinner than other Gold Toe socks they will still withstand lots of wear. They almost never ""bunch up"" inside my shoes as I walk around and they are very much worth the price. They last longer so the long life of these socks justifies the slightly higher price.I also like the design of the toe section actually being gold colored fabric. Amazon points out that these socks come in your choice of four different colors: black, navy blue, grey marl and brown. The safest, most conservative choice for the corporate office is the black color; but the other colors come in handy too depending on your work/play ""dress code.""These socks can easily be washed in any washer or dryer--but I would heed the manufacturer's warning about not drying them at a high temperature. High temperatures in the clothes dryer cause the sock to wear out faster. The stretch nylon will stretch even more; and then these socks will become just too loose on your feet.Please note that these are crew length socks. They will not come up your leg to the degree that some other socks will. You may consider them to be ""too short."" On the other hand, the socks also fit shoe sizes 7 through 12 so it's almost one size fits all. Overall, Gold Toe is the brand to buy if you want good quality, long lasting socks. The ""Canterbury Dress Socks"" for men match any attire and they can even be worn in bed on those really cold nights to keep your feet warm! Highly recommended! May you wear them in good health!

It seems better made than most.  In particular, the belt buckle seems of a higher quality than most, and that's been the point of failure of two of my previous packs.  (I wish I could find one with a metal buckle.)There are two changes I would make to this design.  First, the side pockets are too small because they join the main part of the pack in a single seam.  The front panel of the side pocket needs to join the main front panel of the pack in a second seam maybe 3/8"" farther forward.  This would make the side pockets much larger and more useful.Besides that, I note that there is only a single seam joining the belt to the pack.  Time will tell, but I suspect this may become a failure point.  A second or even third row of stitching here would make me feel more confident.All that said, it seems like a very good pack -- the zippers and pulls are of high quality, the pockets are all lined, there are plenty of pockets including two security pockets for money and other small valuables -- and I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could -- just not 5 :-",United States,CA

Looked at some very pricey options at local stores and couldn't find anything with the style I was looking for.  Took the risk and bought this over the internet (for significantly less $ than the others I was considering) and I am extremely happy with it.  The case, even when full is not bulky, but stores a surprising amount.  There are open slots that hold both my notebook and my organizer, a zippered section for my files, two flat zippered sections for miscelanious papers, two 1/2 size pockets for holding my camera and a newspaper perfectly, slots for business cards and a pen organizer.  Quality is great, thick leather, nice stitching.  My only minor complaint is the latches are magnetic.  I prefer the physical catch type as they are a little easier to latch without looking. I actually took some brown shoe polish to it right away to give it more of an aged patina and love it.  I also cut off the stupid cell-phone holder because I thought it was ugly, bulky, and I would never use it even if my phone fit.

I hesitated to order this bra for a long time, as it appears to be pretty ugly in the photo displayed here, but I am pleased to say that in person, it's actually rather pretty.  However, be aware that there are 4 hooks in the back, so forget about your amour quickly unclasping it in during a moment of passion.  These hooks and the stretchy, sheer fabric provide substantial support though, and the wide straps are comfortable and won't leave whiplash marks upon the shoulders.  Unfortunately, the bra is cut rather narrow at the upper sides, heading towards the underarms.  Depending on your build, this can mean that the sides of your breasts will squish out, which is unattractive and indicative of a poor fit, so ordering a larger cup size than normal might be necessary",Qatar,

But nice and comfortable and well-broken in.  While much negative commentary concerning Levi Strauss's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s, the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970's standby, the 505, which has a zipper as opposed to button fly. The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. The 501 are easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called ""anti-fit"" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. The 501s are pretty safe as far as sizing. ",United States,DC

I used to wear Nike, until I read in Runner's World Magazine that the ASICS GT-1100 was the Editor's Choice for best overall running shoe, so I thought, why not? In the past I've dealt with shin splints, knee pain and plantar fasciitis(a.k.a. really sore feet), but my ASICS 1100s kept me healthy and comfortable, and relatively stylish. I've been a committed Asics devotee since.I own ASICS Kayano running shoes, which cost $135 - considerably more than the GT series - and truthfully, I find no difference between the two except for the price. Also, there is not much difference within the GT series. I've owned GT-1100, GT-1120, GT-2110 and GT-2120 - all are superior. So, find the style and color to suit your budget - and enjoy comfortable running to your heart's content (or until you rack up 300 miles, after which you should replace your Asics as all running shoes start to lose their support and stability after around 300 miles. FYI - many local track clubs have programs in which they collect retired running shoes and donate them to impoverished children and adults. Spread the Asics comfort! Because though the shoes are no longer optimal for running after 300 miles, they still make great ""kick-around"" shoes and are cute and fun for casual wear. Sorry about the digression...If you run short or medium distances (&lt;30 miles per week), this is the shoe for you.",United States,SD

The site shows it above the knee's, the two I received, are below the knee, almost mid-calf...& I'm 5'9. It is a ""halter"" top. On the site, I think they just rested the straps over her shoulders & did not tie behind her next. ALSO, I knew the dress was cotton, NOT T-SHIRT cotton sundress. Now, I have two dresses that I'm not really happy w/. I haven't had time to return them. I bought them looking for a sundress to wear out & about...this, I would probably only wear as a beach cover up or to the pool. Haven't decided. Once I get around to getting to a post office, I plan on returning them. I keep trying them on, thinking, ""Ok, it's only $20, I should keep them."" But I most probably would NOT have bought them if I tried them on in the store. They would look cute if they were shorter, but that is more money that I would have to spend to shorten the dress. So is it really worth it??? Haven't decided yet. The fact I can't decided what to do w/ them, makes me believe I need to return them. If I loved them, I would have already worn them, but I haven't.

I was fitted for this bra before I bought it, but the store didn't have my size so I started looking for the bra online.  I ordered exactly the size that I was fitted for, received my two bras, and the fit was terrible. The bra is too tight, and the cups don't fit.  I'm not spilling out over the sides of the bra, usually the first indicator that the bra doesn't fit, there's all this extra material in the center of the cup.  Aside from my fitting problems there are two other problems with this bra I'd like to point out.  Being full figured there are two things necessary to support bigger chests.  First, a bra band that is wide and has four hooks on it, this bra does not have that.  Second, you need wide, supportive straps, again this bra does not have wide enough straps.

Then try this bra,"June 27, 2006",copchick11,Illinois,"Given the fact that I have not been able to EVER find a comfortable bra that also supported my D size chest (and my picky posture and displeasure for underwire), this bra has won the battle.  There's just a couple of quirks, but that could just be me.  When I tighten the straps, they eventually give way and losen up a bit.  I find myself adjusting them every 3-4 wears.  I'm considering sewing the straps permanently at that adjustment. I hand wash it in cold water with mild soap and hang to dry. Sometimes tumble on low heat or air tumble and the shape and size stay consistent.  I lost just a hair of weight in my breats and the bra fitted a little loser.  Because of this, vertical ""waves"" in the cup material appeared, but that was because there wasn't enough to fill the bra.  Once I gained that size back (unfortunately!) and filled the cup fully, the ridges disappeared.I've had this one for 10 months and wear it every day, and it's still in great shape!

Having stated that, I have been very impressed with the support of this bra.Having a larger-than-average chest size (the bra I purchased was an ""f"" cup) I have become accustomed to purchasing bras which offer support initially only to, if you'll pardon the pun, let me down within a week or so of wearing them.  ""Tisha"" has offered solid support.  This bra has hiked my bosom up and kept it up all day.  I have not experienced any sagging or shifting of the garment.As I mentioned the support is excellent, it has even passed the ""jiggle test"".  If I have to hurry somewhere or, heaven forbid, break into a jog ""the girls"" stay where they ought offering no threat of injury to me or any innocent passer-by.  The side supports are, no doubt part of the reason for the bra's effectiveness but they can pinch a bit.  In short, it feels GOOD to take the bra off at the end of the day.  I do not however fantasize about slipping out of it at lunchtime to ease aching shoulders or alleviate pain as I have with some others.A bra is, quite naturally, a very personal garment and therefore difficult to recommend but I do recommend this bra for large-busted women.

I got the leather tags with the cover up flap. I was tired of having mismatched tags that I had scraped up from anywhere and everywhere. I was also looking for a tag that kept my personal information covered up from strangers standing nearby. Another thing I was looking for was a tag that was strong. It was not uncommon for me to pick up my luggage in the airport to discover my tag had been ripped off. Sometimes part of it was left. Sometimes all of it was gone. Luggage and their tags take a lot of abuse.OK about this product...They are real leather. They are nice looking. There are two reasons why I am giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating. First the leather is a little on the thin side. It would be a nice thickness to make a ladies purse or a fine wallet for a businessman in a suit but...a luggage tag? Like I said, these tags need to be virtually indestructable to survive. I am a little dubious that the thin leather strap will really hold up. I may be wrong...this is only my speculation at this point. The second thing is the price. It seems to me that this product should be in the 3 to 4 dollar, each, price range instead of the 5 to 6 dollar range.There are different colors available which is good (I bought green) because nowadays 95% of all the bags coming down the conveyor are BLACK. Everyone needs something on the outside of their bag to help make it easily identifiable. These colored tags do that",United States,OK

B000MT51B2,Levi's® Strauss 501® Button Fly Jeans Available in Many Colors: Apparel,apparel,1 of 1,5.0,501 easier to buy online ,"March 12, 2007",Great Faulkner's Ghost,"Washington, DC","While much of the negative commentary concerned Levi Strauss's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s, the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970's standby, the 505, which has a zipper as opposed to button fly. The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. You really have to try them on to see how they fit. The 501 are much easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called ""anti-fit"" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. Since the 501s are more forgiving as far as sizing, if you are buying online you might consider them instead of 505s, unless you don't want the button fly.",United States,DC

B000A0I3Z4,Voltaic Solar Panel Backpack - Free Shipping: Apparel,apparel,14 of 14,5.0,can your prada bag charge my cell phone?,"November 8, 2006",R. A. Brumleve,"chicago, il","I have had this bag for a little over a year, and I love it.  Ok, some stuff you need to know......this bag will charge your cellphone, ipod, pda, camera, and AA and AAA batteries (ipod and batteries require purchase of seperate adaptors.  you can find them at [...])  I think it takes about 6-8 hours to charge from nothing using the sun, but you can confirm that on the above website.  It also has an adaptor to charge the battery at home or in the car.  This backpack will NOT charge your laptop.  The space provided for the solar collection isn't big enough.  There are seperate solar arrays that you can purchase that fold up and go in a backpack (i've seen them for about $200).  The upside to the backpack is that you don't have to be stationary for it to be collecting power, unlike the folding arrays.   I wear mine while walking around chicago, or cycling to and from work and school.  The bag isn't much heavier than a ""non-solar"" bag.  Infact, once i put all my school books in it, i couldn't tell the difference between the weight of this one and my old bag. Even in the cold chicago winter, i can get a charge on a relatively clear day.  (i.e.  it doesn't have to be hot outside, just sunny.)  Also, be aware that this bag has a battery that stores the power you collect until you're ready to use it, some other manufactures have no battery, which means that you have to be in the sun when you want to charge something.  I didn't purchase my bag through amazon, (though i must say i'm thrilled that they are carrying it now.)  I dealt directly with voltaic systems, and their customer service is on point.  i hope this review was helpful to you",United States,IL

The frilly lacework which decorates the waist band - as well as the two lengths which dive between your thighs - make this Flutter Butt crotchless panty extremely pretty!  As an added touch, there's another small piece of the lacey stuff - as well as a handsome ribbon-like bow - featured down front.  Although they might be hard to see in the accompanying photo - both serve to give the overall garment a much more finished appearance - while also offering an attractive focal point for the eye!The fluffy waistband on this Flutter Butt crotchless undie - also helps to accentuate your hips - by providing a little skirt-like appearance.If you have other frilly lingerie, this crotchless knicker - by heightening the tease - might make this a very fun and memorable addition to your collection. For me, my most baby-like babydoll nightie - which had a short bodice and a billowy skirt (with almost no waist) - ended up coordinating quite nicely.  It also helped that my hubby had ordered this Flutter Butt undie in ""white"" rather than ""red.""When I sprang this outfit on my better-half, I also made certain to peek up at him - with my most shyly innocent (and dopey) expression - while using my index finger to seductively play with my lower lip!

I have been buying NB shoes for as long as I can remember, and this is the first time my toes were obviously at the very end of the toe box. They look good though, and provide the great arch support New Balance is famous for.It's always a good idea to try on shoes before you buy them, but the online price is so seductive, it's difficult to pass up the ""deal"". If possible, try to find some at your local shoe store before you purchase these, as the pictures don't show you all angles of this shoe, and parts of the trim are (in my opinion) ""goofy"" looking.Overall, I'd recommend these shoes for walking/jogging/going to the gym.

B000G5ZTVE,Men's Bates M-9 Desert Assault: Apparel,apparel,2 of 2,5.0,Quite possibly the best boot ever made.,"January 18, 2007","Eric E. Rinderer ""rindeee""",St. Louis,"I am a deployed Navy Reservist.  I am currently assigned to a tactical expeditionary unit deployed to the middle-east where I serve in a TACCOMM/Tactical Crypto Support role in land and maritime operations.  Before deploying, I spent a great deal of time and effort in selecting the 'right boot' in which I knew I would be spending a great deal of time.  I tried Oakley, Converse, 5.11 and of course the Bates M-9.  I felt that there was no contest.  The Bates was by far the most comfortable and seemed to have the most functional sole design and least potentially irritating upper, and so on. Let me re-wind a little bit.  In my civilian life, outside of the Reserve (which at this point seems a distant memory) I am an avid runner, to the tune of about 70 miles per week.  While I've run many hundred of miles on roads, my focus over the past couple of years has shifted to off-road 'trail runs' and ultra-marathon courses.  I know my feet.  I know what works in a shoe that is going to be demanded to perform in horrible conditions.  I have had great success over time with literally one pair of shoes from one manufacturer and as such I bought many pairs of that shoe.  In June of 2006, I bought my first pair of M-9 Desert Assault boots to take on my July deployment.  I decided that in order to break them in, I'd take them on the trail.  I figured that they'd tear my feet up a bit, but it wouldn't be the first time a new shoe had done so.  The day I first wore them I set off with an 85lb. pack into a tick infested trail in a local state park.  It was about 100 degrees outside with humidity nearly to match.  After 12 miles on the trail I returned home to find that my feet were all but un-fouled!  I was amazed.  I would repeat this process a few times and very soon after ordered two additional pairs of M-9s. Fast forward just a bit. While in pre-deployment training in Coronado, CA, I took to wearing my boots for all of our PT.  I also logged about 30 to 50 miles per week of independent running, again, in my M-9s.  Most of these runs included a pack with about 50 - 70lbs in it, though now I was running almost entirely on pavement.  My M-9's performed without flaw.  I left Coronado for the middle east without any doubt that I had the best boots I could have possibly chosen, and they were well broken in to boot. ;)Fast forward some more.  Recently I was able to take a two day MWR trip in order to run the Dubai (UAE) Marathon...in my M-9s.  While we (there were five of us from my unit that ran the marathon) have had almost no opportunity to do any training runs while in theater, I knew that if I were to tackle 26.2 miles on pavement (man, I hate running on pavement), there was no way I was going to do so without wearing my 'old faithfuls'.  They did not disappoint!  While I took a very conservative pace, my M-9s carried me with ease to the finish line.  My Chief, also the proud owner of a well beaten pair of M-9's ran the marathon with me, his first ever.  He too wore his M-9s, as his running shoes were simply shot.  He was nothing short of elated to have finished his first marathon attempt, and others were nothing short of amazed that he did it in 'combat boots'.  If they only knew. ;)  I must say, I've never had so many people come up to me during a marathon to chat and in every case, the topic was my choice of footwear.  In every instance I would simply tell them with a smile, ""You don't understand, these are really great boots."" In short, Bates created a nearly perfect boot. Are there things I would change? Certainly. But even if Bates never changes a thing about them, I will keep buying them until I am not longer able to run, which I assure you will not be for a very long time.  I have already scheduled additional marathons and ultra-marathons (off road of course) for after I return home, and I'll let you guess what my choice of footwear will be.  I have found my new 'running shoe'.",United States,MO

They are so comfortable and I expect to get many years of use of them.One small problem, the inside sole is orange and I found that it turns my socks yellow from the dye.

Anyways, I bought it, shipping charges and all on the 18th. Later on, I go to Amazon because , when I'm bored I go to Amazon, lol. Imagine how annoyed I was when I saw it was the same price, but as you know Amazon has FREE SHIPPING on products over a certain amount, ALWAYS. I figured what's done is done, but I revisit laurensilva.com, and see in bold print FREE SHIPPING Dec 15th- 31st on orders over $50. I'm happy cuz I'm thinking, ""Great I didn't overpay"", I call customer service and she tells me ""Oh, I'm sorry about that that was a mistake on our part that should've said 19th not 15th"" then goes on to say ""My supervisor will call you to let you know about the refund tomorrow."" Received no call. I call the next day around two to hear from the supervisor that even though THEY put the 15th, it was an error and shouldn't have been there, and he wouldn't refund me the 5 bucks. How am I responsible for an error from YOU GUYS. Isn't that FALSE ADVERTISING? I'm so pissed. Now I have to call my credit card company, and might have to deal with them lying about it. I'm so angry.Aside from being deceived, I was treated so poorly. How do people act like this? When I initially called, I had no idea it would turn into this, otherwise I would've had ""gathered evidence."" as my friends tell me. I hate to make a stink over 5 measly bucks, but you should've heard his condescending attitude when he said ""We won't be refunding you the shipping, but thank you for informing us of the error"" .

A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this ""no-show."" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :)For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk.This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not ""cling"" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor.The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.May I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier!I cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection",United States,IL

B000BQ0DL4,Hair Curlers for Travel: Apparel,apparel,5 of 5,5.0,Very convenient and compact: an essential hair tool,"July 15, 2006",Joanna Daneman,"Middletown, DE USA","I have short hair, not ultra-short, but short, and I find that a few hot curlers can make a big difference in volume on ""bad hair days."" While I have a full-sized Conair curler set, I discovered that my travel set was really best suited to my hair length. So travel or not, this little set has become a real favorite. What you get The Remington Travel Hair curlers come in a nylon bag with the heating unit build in. The top is clear and fastened by velcro. You pull it open and plug it in to start heating the rollers. On the side of the nylon bag is a smaller, oblong bag holding the roller clips. There are five medium rollers (about an inch in diameter) and five small rollers, about 5/8 inch diameter.) There are two sets of clips, pink for the large roller, white for the smaller roller. The clip fits around the roller, and has a tab to aid grabbing it for removal. The rollers turn from pink to greyish white when they are heated. They fit into the base over a socket with two prongs. They heat up in about 2 minutes. How they work The rollers claim to have ""Ionic Technology"" to reduce static and the frizzies. I find that my hair is indeed smooth when I take it out of the rollers. After I let the curls cool, I can style with no frizz. The ends of the rollers stay cool to avoid burning your head. They are a bit heavy. I leave the rollers in for five to fifteen minutes, by which time my hair is well-curled. Upsides, downsides To keep this set compact, there are only 10 rollers. I could use a few more, even with my short hair. The built-in travel bag is very well designed and compact for a suitcase or small bathroom. If you LOSE THE CLIPS, you can find a general replacement style of clip for about $10 at http://www.ballbeauty.com/remington_hair_setters.htm#CLIPS. I dropped two of my white clips and the cats apparently made off with them as trophies of their hunting prowess. So this is helpful to know where to buy more clips. The curls last long, though they aren't as stiff as with some of the more expensive, foam covered type of curlers",United States,DE

They can be worn during hiking trips without the fear of the soles being punctured by brush. It's rare to see, but the Betula spinoff of Birkenstock comes and goes every couple years or so. The pair Im replacing are Betulas and I bought them 3yrs ago. As it turns out, you can have Birkenstock sandals repaired over time as long as the cork isnt too badly damaged. All one has to do is take them to a liscensed dealer and 25.00 later, you have a repaired pair of sandals. Other brands can come up with knockoffs, but nothing matches a true anatomically correct Birkenstock. I suggest going to a store that sells Birkenstocks and seeing what size your largest foot is before buying online so as to avoid the hassle of having to mail back the sandals and trying to get the correct size. Once you have all the necessary info, you are set to buy them to your feet's content. You wont regret buying these sandals. The comfort is unmatched.

I was hopeful about this bra, because it was decently priced~~and I wasn't disappointed. The underwire and 4 hooks give excellent hold, the cups are deep enough to cover everything (and keep things pointing up where they belong), and the criss-cross lacing between the cups gives it just enough of the peek-a-boo allure to make it sexy.

These did not disappoint me.  Working as a carpenter/woodworker, I am in these boots all day long.  My feet never get tired or sore from being in them.

When I am not working, my regular shoes seem to not comfort me as well.  Walking a mall or just getting around town in street shoes can make my  back and  legs ache after only a couple hours.  Yet, these Pit Boss boots can let me be on my feet standing/walking for as much as 10hrs straight without feeling sore.These have been a blessing climbing or standing on ladders for extended time as the sole is solid enough to give me a good platform to stand on.

But be warned, My daughters larger text books dont fit,nor does her mead trapper looseleaf or her nike portfolio. The top corner sticks out about two to three inches and zipper is unable to fully close, so she has to carry them in her hands; which kind of defeats the purpose of carrying a handsfree bag. Spiral notebooks and mead composition books(black and white) fit perfectly. ...Another gripe is she is probably 100 pounds soaking wet, so the strap isn't flush to her body. Shes a tall slim 13 1/2 year old. It will fit the chubbies and the bustier girls a whole lot better. The velcor strip is short, so there isn't much more ability to adjust to make it tighter....Samsonite can either make the strap shorter so it doesnt hit her booty when she walks or lenghten the amount of velcro they use so theres more ability to adjust the fit. We thought that during the colder months it might fit a little better with her winter coats, but it still hits her too low on her body. We'd rather it be a more snug fit. She still loves it though, because of the color and it holds all her stuff well...cell phone, ipod, keys, bus pass,pens etc. Minus 1/2 a star for size and fit.

If you're going to wear it for more than 5 miles (45 min of exercising), I would highly recommend buying bodyglide or using some vaseline, as it does start to chafe the skin in the center of the bra band in front.Don't let the price make you think twice- if you are looking for the best exercise bra, you've just found it",United States,CA

Genetically, we're predisposed to big bustlines, which has its advantages and disadvantages - one of the latter trying to find bras that fit and support and still look good.  I've tried many, many other sports bras (trying to find one from the $20 range that works) and none of the other compare - the racerback types don't give me enough support - other 'high compression' bras create that oh-so-unattractive 'uniboob' look; underwire sports bras have a very short life - they're a pain to keep washed and it doesn't take long for the underwire to pop out of the underarm area (ouch - always seemed to happen during a heavy workout!), et cetera.The Champion Action Shape takes care of ALL of that.  There is enough separation where this looks fine even wearing under a shirt (I've even been able to wear this bra under a blouse or sweater if I'm planning on going horseback riding after work).  The straps and fasteners are totally adjustable.  The bra is mostly cotton, there might be some lycra or polyester there but I'm a cotton freak - no itchiness, no seams that chafe, and best of all NO UNDERWIRE!  It's totally supportive - as I mentioned, I ride horseback (this trumps the popular rider's ""No Bounce Bra"" that sells for over $50 and has a ton of hooks - like a corset - UGH), and am also a gym rat, doing high-impact aerobics, weight training, Spinning, Pilates and yoga - this bra is EMINENTLY suitable for all those activities.  Care is easy - just toss it in the washer and dryer or air dry (I generally airdry as the hooks have a tendency to get caught in the 'holes' in the dryer).  And they look GOOD.  I just wear this as a top on its own.BTW Champion has come out with a new color this year - Champion RED.  I just got it and it looks AWESOME!HIGHLY recommended",United States,CA

Never mind all the mellifluous flubdrub about nature-formed last, footwear classic, nineteen sixty-five, etc. The facts of the matter are that (a) the Irish factory where Wallabees were handmade with love closed down in the late 1990s; (b) the product has been made in mainland China since that time; (c) the materials and workmanship don't begin to come close to their former standards, which is duly reflected in the downward price shift ($180 in 1998 but $110 in 2006, inflation notwithstanding); yet (d) the Web sites--which claim that the shoe is ""even better""--seem to have no problem with posting photos of the no-longer-available Irish craftsewns while shipping the Chinese hack jobs. Very, very disappointing, gentlemen.  (I once found a fellow in Ottawa who had bought up considerable quantities of sand suede Wallabees and was selling them at a premium--$225--that I was happy to pay, but even he ultimately went out of business, just like Peter, my custom Birkenstock sandalmaker in Germany.)I once phoned the vendor to complain, and some imbecile tried to explain to me that the product was ""better than ever."" I flew into a rage, telling her what she could do with her lies. I also chastised her for having the brass-bound gall to lie to me, a diehard Wallabee fan who has continuously owned (and worn, day in and day out) several pairs--sand suede, oakwood suede, brown leather, and/or black leather--since the age of fifteen, two-thirds of a lifetime ago! (The oakwood [= dark brown] suede were always my favorites, since the sand suede always looked a little too smart-Alecky for me, making me look [quite accurately!] like an upper-middle-class New York City Jewish boy--just mate them with Sergio Valente jeans, a creamy velour shirt, and an ultra-expensive sweater.)All that having been vented, the Wallabee is still a reasonably comfortable shoe--assuming you can find two members of a pair that actually match within a reasonable margin of deviation! Teenage kids won't know the difference, but baby-boomers will be moved to tears. Get with the program and buy either a pair of those ultra-advanced, computer-designed, ruggedized flip-flops (there are scores of vendors) or some quality suede sneakers (leather ones are far too oppressive for the educated foot).

Bean, Fox Racing Inc., and Timberland (and Barney's New York for that matter) stock up on great, genuinely tough, useful, comfortable, and attractive clothing like these shorts--and everything else Carhartt makes.  These are clothes that make you feel and look good (""comfort clothes"" you might say) while you're rolling around in the dirt or even on your living room floor.I laude the previous reviewer's honesty in saying they're great for wearing without underwear in the hot weather, because they really, really are.  Jeans / denim and most cotton cloth can get hot, and that can be  real uncomfortable particularly for a man's 'bait and tackle;' whereas this cloth breathes exceptionally well.  They're particularly great for after doing endurance sports and taking a shower--when you're body is still all reved up--as a loose, comfortable cool-down clothing that you're fine wearing the rest of the day.The pockets and loops are also very handy, not only for working on a car, bike, or doing construction, but also plenty big enough to carry your cell phone (even my Treo), keys, and wallet comfortably without being like those huge, ugly military-style thigh pockets.I expect Carhartt might someday start marketing itself just like other great, functional brands that went hip-hop style or suburb/country sheik, and if they do it will be a real loss.  But for now at least we can enjoy another in that long series of brands that became famous for function before it was popularized as a suburban teenager fashion and then ruined. ",United States,NY

B000AI5X22,Case Logic 128 Capacity 3-Ring Binder: Apparel,apparel,7 of 7,5.0,The 2nd Best CD Binder Ever,"August 11, 2006","R. Davis ""rddrn""","Madison, AL US","I ditched the bulky jewel cases for my cds a long time ago in favor of nice binders that would hold the disk and the artwork securely without taking up too much space.  Since my collection continues to grow much faster than I anticipated, I recently started looking to buy more binders.  Alas, the ones I already had (No Boundaries, from Wal-Mart of all places) don't seem to be available anymore, so a pretty exhaustive search of online options brought me to this item.  Basically, this binder has pretty much everything I was looking for:  three ring construction, a sturdy zipper closure to keep discs safe and contained, and a sewn-in handle at the back so it's portable.  A plus about this particular model is that the rings are slightly oversized for the stated capacity, so there is the possibiity of expanding by buying more sheets.  I bought three, and they work great.  I will buy more - several more, because they are the best option there is at present.  Let me tell you, however, what I don't like about them.  First, the cover is some sort of plastic or vinyl.  I can see this cracking or disintigrating in a couple of years, even with gentle treatment.  Second, there isn't a proper spine to the binder:  it's basically a single, flexible sheet that wraps around the outside but doesn't make square corners.  That means it will look  untidy on the shelf and also makes me question its long-term durability.  Third, the sleeves:  they are too tight to put the disc and the artwork in the same slot, the ones closest to the rings have their corners notched in to accomodate the rings, and the slits are oriented to the zipper side instead of to the top.   Those drawbacks aside, I plan to buy more of these.  They are the best choice available now, but I wouldn't hesitate to ditch them if something better became available.  If you are looking for a safe, flexible, and smart place to store a lot of cds, this item should be at the top of your list.  ",United States,AL

I like the fact that it is zippered on three sides, keeps everything in the wallet. I am female, and while wallets are traditionally a male style, I wanted something that wasn't just a coin purse or a typical woman's purse - you know, with the clasp pouch for coins and dividers etc, b/c I find those very cumbersome. This is compact, light, it has plenty of pockets, slots and dividers inside - that zip again comes in handy if you fill up all the spaces inside it ensures you won't lose anything.I gave it four stars instead of five just b/c the coin pocket (while strategically placed and pleasingly compact) is a little hard to get your fingers in to put coins in and take them out quickly, it's kind of tight. Also, the center divider (for your pictures or drivers license etc.) sometimes gets in the way when you want to zip the wallet up - like if you are in a hurry to get out of the line at Starbucks and you are struggling to shove your change in the little slot and zip it up!But this really is a great purse/wallet.

It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid. If you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period. For those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it. Clearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise pants and (2) make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low-rise pants. I found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthetics of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contours pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive. Practical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of ""expansion room"". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs. If you forsee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C?

B0006IY41M,"Cloth Parasol, Pink Color w/Flowers #8000P: Apparel",apparel,15 of 15,4.0,Pretty parasol,"April 6, 2005","E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",MD USA,"For some reason, parasols for the photosensitive are hard to find -- most are hideously expensive and not very good looking. The House of Rice silk parasol, however, is an exception to the rule. They manage to be pretty, useful and surprisingly sturdy.Except for a white, painted handle, the parasol's frame is entirely made of bamboo. It looks fragile, but is surprisingly sturdy, especially since it is bound together with colorful threads and bamboo pegs. Over that is asemi-transparent pale yellow silk canopy, and a matching ribbon on the top to hang it from.How does it stand up in the sun? Well, the silk is technically transparent, but when unfolded it does provide a certain amount of shade -- about the same as a pair of sunglasses. Aesthetically, it is also very good, simple and unadorned except by a few extra scraps of silk, but very elegant and understated. The only problem is that to keep the parasol open, you have to essentially shove it up onto a jutting wedge of bamboo. It's a bit of a pain to close.The House of Rice silk parasol is meant to look pretty, but it can also be used for the parasol's origina function. Definitely a good find, if you can get it closed easily",United States,MD

B000G11JLW,Kroo Creative Labs Zen Vision M Armband Accessory Case: Apparel,apparel,2 of 2,1.0,Buy this product if you want to break your MP3 player,"October 1, 2006",Stan Shimizu,"Shoreline, WA United States","This is by far, the worst product you could ever purchase for your very expensive MP3 player.  I had purchased this item after trying out one of the silcone skins that ripped apart after about 3 months of use.  I use my MP3 player when I go running and so I need an armband product that can withstand the elements and my running.  After using this product only 3 times, it began to fall apart as follows:1.  The protective screen cover is nothing but a flimsly piece of plastic that is glued to the case.  It basically falls apart when you try and squeeze your vision M into the case. 2.  There are these oddly placed velcro dots on the armband that are used to secure it after you wrap it around your arm.  The huge design flaw is that the dots needs to line up on top of one another in order to be secure.  So, if you arm is an odd sign you end up having to make it tighter in order to align the dots.  If you're in the market for a tourniquet, then you should buy this product. 3.  If you sweat at least a drop while you exercise or run (if you don't then you're not really exercising), the velcro dots lose their stick-um.  I discovered that the fuzzy part of the velcro was glued onto the armband.  As it heats up from your body temperature rising, it literally melts and causes the dots to fall off.  It was because of this that my MP3 player almost flew off my arm and onto the cement.  So, if you are looking to shatter your MP3 player, then buy this nifty product.  I think that my son (age 4) could've designed a better arm band holder in his pre-school class. ",United States,WA

","June 23, 2006","Eager  Reader ""elenaruggs""","Braintree, MA","Shoes.com provided wonderfully fast service and a decent sandal price.  Too bad my feet are so impossible; my fault, not theirs!  A friend with a larger size and  medium width tells me she has worn hers ""Margie"" sandal comfortably for 12 years.  They still look new, as evidenced by my ordering them after seeing how lovely they were when she wore them to a recent event.Bass always produces a good product.  I ordered the ""tan distressed"" and they are beautiful sandals, with sumptuously comfy soles.  They are adequately sturdy, while also enabling feet to still look dainty and shapely.  For the $30 which I paid, free postage, they are a fairly good buy.  Nevertheless, these sandals are not perfectly comfortable for me, perhaps more my fault than theirs.  My advice to a person with small, narrow feet is that this product may not be exactly right.  The front straps are in a fixed position, as are most strappy sandals, while the back ones are adjustable.  This said, the size 7 Narrow is not for a truly narrow foot, mainly due to the positioning and size of the front straps.  I will keep these sandals and can wear them ""around,"" but on day trips or shopping I would probably not be able to endure the slight floppiness.  There is just a tad too much give for my  foot.  Even the back strap isn't quite perfect for me, as it tends to force the foot forward when adjusted in the tightest position.  Yet I need the very tightest buckle hole in order to keep the shoe on my foot at all.  Would I have bought these had I been shopping in a store, where I could have tried them on?  Probably not.  But I've been to dozens of quality shoe stores already this summer, to no avail seeking my size in this type sandal. At one point, I went store-to-store at a huge outlet mall, hitting every place with shoes, including Bass itself.  At one store, Etienne Aigner, I was so frustrated that I made the comment that they no longer carried either my size or my style.  When the saleswoman heard I wore a narrow, she said, ""Oh we'll, never go back to THOSE again.""  It seems as if most stores consider customers with dainty, narrow feet an oddity, not deserving to find shoes at all.   So perhaps, in spite of my dissatisfaction with the sandals in question, I did well by ordering them.  ",United States,MA

I read from the other reviews there were scratches caused mainly the space above the click wheel and below the screen. I checked the stitching before placing my 30GB video iPod in. The stitchings around the border were soft. But when I felt the stitchings around the click wheel hole I can see why there were alot of complaints of ipod scratching around there. The sitchings were a bit more rough aound the click wheel than it is around the screen. But from other reviews i have read, there were no scratches from long term use of the case.But i have nothing to worry about because I have kept the plastic adhesive sheet that came with the iPod. So I suggest to those who want to be cautious, try buying the adhesive protective sheet if you dont have it or you could just wrap your iPod in saran wrap.After just taking my iPod out it left some sticky residue on the back, ugh, took me forever to rub it off the edges but it still left some residue.

They have a modest amount of tone-on-tone, silky embroidery and just enough trim detail to make them pretty without being ornate or overdone. Their true appeal, however, lies in their comfort. There is nothing binding or fussy about these gowns and their length (below the knee to mid-calf, depending on your height) helps prevent night time tangles. The light weight of the fabric does make them a bit revealing, as an earlier poster noted, so add a robe if you're not feeling particularly brave when you step out to pick up the morning paper",United States,FL

B000B5ZOWI,Performance Clear Rain Jacket: Apparel,apparel,3 of 3,4.0,This is what you novices need for your local yearly cycling event.,"January 8, 2006","John P. Thiel ""John T.""","Astoria, Queens, New York City","The old standby for a suddenly wet and/or chilly windy ride is to wear a garbage bag.  It works but you would really rather be wearing a jacket that can be zipped and unzipped.A decent cycling jacket costs about $150 more or less, but if you're a novice you don't need to blow that kind of cash, and this jacket will serve you fine.  Keep it with you just in case, and see the envy on others faces as they shiver in their lycra or suffer the sauna conditions of wearing a garbage bag to keep dry because they didn't carry this handy bit that easily fits in a jersey pocket or any kind of backpack without too much bulk.Keeping the wind out alone is a big way to keep warm in foul conditions, while continuous riding will produce more than enough heat to keep you warm most of the time.If you're heading out for, say, NYC's Five Borough Bike Tour in May, and don't know what to buy, your basics are: some kind of jersey--a CoolMax shirt will do; 6 panel or more cycling shorts with a chamois (pad) where the sun don't shine; light / thin socks (Air-e-ators are best); and one of these jackets.  These and a helmet and you're set for serious riding.Skip the bulky layers for warmth.  If you want that bit of insulation you may need, get a $10 polarfleece vest from a bargain store, and one of these jackets. I take one star because it doesn't have vented armpits, but on second thought I probably shouldn't have in consideration of the price to value ratio",United States,NY

I found that in hats with the Bailey Wool-Felt hat.Its comfortable and because of its material, you don't have to baby it like some hats.  If something smashes it down, it can easily be reformed back to its original shape.  The hats style alone does not say cowboy or retired yuppie, but has more practicality to it that represents an adventurer or even just an ""average joe"" with class.  Its a working mans hat to wear to town, or a city mans hat to wear while relaxing by a stream after a day of fly fishing.  Make sure to check the sizing chart if you are ordering online (I use my baseball caps, which have the sizing mark on the inside tag, as a reference) otherwise it might be best to try one on at the store and make sure it fits.  I like the way they have various sizes that encompass different exact measurements, that way no matter what, you'll find the size you are looking for.  I only say this because with baseball caps I've had trouble finding the cap I like in the pro back (non adjustable) size I need.I found the drawstring a nice addition but not something I really needed as there are never to high of winds whenever I'm wearing mine.

I love the look and the comfort and support. Jockey Elance bikinis were the first I bought, and years later, they are still what I wear most of all. I've since bought many other styles (boxers, boxer briefs, classic briefs, thongs, and other bikini styles) and brands, but it's pretty much the exception to the rule when I wear anything but Jockey Elance. Contrary to what others have said, they are well made. I've had a number of them for years, and they still hold up. I also think they are really comfortable. Also, someone said they are knock off of women's underwear. Jockey made men's Elance bikinis long before they made ANY underwear for women. However, online you can generally only get them in black, grey, and white, which are ok, but not the most fun. You can get a wider variety of colors at department stores. Walmart sells them in a huge variety of colors as the Life brand. But a lot better than these are the Hanro Cotton Stretch brief, also for sale on Amazon.

This is the first review of this thong?Unbelieveable! I am a ""newbie"" to the thong market after growing up wearing what my Mom told me to wear; cotton briefs (tighty whiteys). Consider me liberated! After going through my initial ""ordering frenzy"" of thong underwear (much to my wife's ""you're developing a mid-life thong fetish"" dismay) I happened upon these.They are what I would consider a ""contour or pouch"" style thong and they are, hands down, the BEST OVERALL THONG I have ever worn! They have a cotton mesh pouch (sexy, but not really ""see-through"") that is the most comfortable ride my ""boys"" have ever had. I absolutley love them/live in them. The Brazilian T-back makes the support across the Netherlands all but unnoticeable while the stretchy sides provide frontal support and all-around comfort. Plus, check out the price! OMG! Anyone who's shopped for a name brand thong knows the average going price is between 15 and 25 dollars.At 8 bucks, these thongs are unbeatable, and if you don't mind the color yellow you can own one for 5. Too good! I bought two of every color and am hoping they still make these when those wear out. It will be a sad day in the Underworld when these thongs become unavailable.Attention atheltes; added bonus! These are comfortable enough to wear while running, jogging or working-out. The cotton pouch is softer than any jock I've ever encountered (while offering equal support) and the lack of those ""butt straps"" adds an easy 2-3 mph to my runs. Seriously (I'm sure it's physcological)! THESE THONGS ROCK. Plus, she thinks they are way sexy (bonus-bonus, nudge-nudge) as the pouch was designed and sewn by someone who knows something about the male anatomy and physiology (evoking ""Yeah, Baby, Yeah"" from the Mrs). Don't miss out on these - you'll be sorry",United States,CA

Period.I have worn my pair for several years. I wore them daily while walking everywhere I went in Europe. Then I wore them daily while walking miles a day in the advertising business. These shoes have never let me down. The only thing I had to replace was the shoelaces - one time.I never felt out of place wearing these shoes. Never did I feel that I was too formal in these shoes, nor too casual when meeting clients or attending formal dinners. My so called ""casual"" sneakers got demoted to strictly playing tennis after I bought these shoes.As for the comfort, my feet have probably been spoiled because of these shoes. Even if I have to work 16 hour days my feet are still fine. For as much as I've worn these shoes and worked 80 hour weeks in them, the shoes still don't have an odor to them other than that of well worn leather (and it's barely discernable). I've never applied anything to the shoes, save for shoe polish.I'm having to buy my second pair now because my first pair I've worn out after owning them for almost 5 years. The top of the shoes are fine, only minor abrasions are visible if I don't polish the shoes once in a while. It is the soles that are wearing out, I've worn them down to almost nothing.I was very lucky to discover Bostonian and I believe I'll never have to hunt for comfortable shoes again that also look great",United States,CA

My daughter is now three months old and I find that I wear the Bravados only when my $12 Motherhood Maternity sleep bras are dirty.  I love the Motherhood bras (though I wear the sleep bra all day long).  They are much softer, easier to get on and off and the cups just pull down instead of snapping.  Even with the Bravado, I just pull the cup down instead of snapping it because it is so cumbersome to re-snap.  I won't be buying anymore Bravados.

Allen Greenbaum,California,"Orvis must employ some high-priced copy writers for their catalogues, because their customarily high-priced clothes need all the sales acumen money can buy (and perhaps Orvis passes their salaries on to you...). Hence, their 'why buy one pattern when you get get more' pitch. In any event, if you can't get a sale item that you like better than this at Orvis.com, you'll at least feel you got a halfway decent price for this thick, warm, and surprisingly good-looking sweater.  While not made in Ireland, it has that sheep-yarn-crofter-whiskey-handmade look, and you can lie about its origin with ease.  THe medium heft fits its design and function, and the colors coordinate well: You will not look garish or overdressed.In short, it's one of their few patchwork type items that really works (another being the ""Irish cap).  For examples of this concept taken to a ridiculous extreme, look for the patchwork Madras, as just one example.  While you're at it, find the corduroy pants with the dogs on it. It's ""country gentleman"" on steroids; the Hamptons after a few too many ethanol teas.But this is a good one...you'll like it. PLease note two things: THe back is not patchwork but a tan-beigy solid (that's ok), and while it's machine washable, it's best to hand dry it or dry clean to prevent shrinking and wear.",United States,CA

Both of which are Adidas and always match.  White/black Adidas sweatshirt = white/black head-band.  Red/white sweatshirt = red/white head-band, orange/white hoodie, orange/white head-band, etc. etc. etc.  At first it was out of practicality... exercising, etc. but with the head-band, well, the story behind that is that I was too cheap to buy a new set of head-phones for djing, and the speaker of the left side broke off, leaving it lose.  Great for djing, but the remnant of the plastic was rather uncomfortable right behind your ear.  So... I had a headband on one day and I got to keep using my old rag-tag headphones that I loved so much (I've since stopped being so cheap and got a new set).  As for why the Adidas hoodies - they're just so incredibly soft and comfortable!  I like them more than the Nike ones, and then I think they're just a bit more stylish.This though is a great sweatshirt.  Very warm, very soft, and pretty cool clors.  I have the cream/red colored one and wear it loads - even though there isn't a matching head-band for it yet.  Drawstring's good, pocket's big... what more can you ask for?  A bit expensive, which is a shame because you know it will be $20 at TJ Maxx next winter.  But still, I like mine. ",United States,MA

I'm 5'4, and they hit at just the right point on my calves, although if I was much shorter, I might think that they were too long. I have an athletic build, but large hips, and I was worried these might make me look huge, but they are very flattering on my body type (I also have a friend who has a pair that is quite slim - a size 2- and they work beautifully on her too). They are ultra comfy and have just the right amount of stretch. Because they are mostly polyester, they aren't really breathable, but they are so lightweight, it's not a factor for me. They are also virtually wrinkle-proof. If you're looking to buy gauchos, or just a comfy pair of hip pants to hit the town in, I would definately recommend these",United States,IL

The explanation for the ""water-resistant"" nylon as opposed to silk lining was that it made it more practical as a backpack, however, this bag is obviously not designed to be a backpack.  The leather is high quality and you wouldn't want to be exposing it to the elements for any significant length of time, much less trying to put anything larger than a paperback in the interior. I really like the versitality of the various pockets and pouches, including the interior wallet, and the magnetic snaps hold everything together pretty well.

When I got pregnant, I was concerned about my back and how it would hold up during the pregnancy.  With the hormone relaxin that is released with pregnancy, our joints loosen up and can't support as much as they do in a non-pregnant state.  This is especially notable at the sacroiliac (SI) joint of our low backs.  Instability of this joint (there's one on each side) can lead to pain.  At about 18 weeks I started having some SI pain.  I got one of these belts and had relief within 24 hours.  For about 2 months I wore it every day to support my SI joints.  I found that if I attached the velcro strap in the front securely, but not tight, then used the two side straps to tighten up the whole belt, I would get the best relief.  I had to be certain the two side straps were even: the seam where they meet in the back was in the CENTER of my back.  I would then pull them around at the same time and attach them so that the fit was snug, but not uncomfortable.  After a couple of months, the baby started getting so big that I started wearing it more as a support for my belly.  As I've gotten bigger and bigger, I've pulled the back part upward slightly, which continues to provide SI support but also helps hold up the baby.  When I take the belt off I REALLY notice the difference.  The support is amazing for such a simple belt (wish I had the patent!)I'm due in a month.  I have had NO back pain since before I used the belt and I continue to work and exercise without problems",United States,WI

Form fitting and soft, elastic is just enough to keep them on, they are everything you want in a pair of undies, but they don't last. I've been wearing bikini style for more than a decade and these are a good economical alternative to the brand that got me started, Calvin Kleins. The Calvins are the Shangri La's that all others strive for. But you got to pay. You only get one pair of Calvins for $15 and here you get 3 Hanes for $11. They are almost identical in feel, the difference is in the construction. The Hanes only have a single layer frontal sheild whereas most other bikinis will double that area up and for good reason. After about a year or so  your buddy downstairs will be busy making himself a little window and who knows what that could lead to. A door or a hatch and then he could bust out and take over. I suppose cost vs. longevity with the Calvins does balance out. They cost 4x as much but last 4x as long. But do our partners want us having the same pair of undies for more than 5 years?

B000JD9FY0,Timbuk2 Classic Messenger Bag: Apparel,apparel,4 of 4,5.0,Very happy,"December 31, 2006",A. Bolt,"New York, NY USA","I recently got a 15"" MacBook Pro and needed a larger bag to accommodate it (replacing my Manhattan Portage 1640 Waxed Canvas Messenger Bag, which I loved). I ordered and returned several things before settling on this. I am very happy. It is a durable, smartly designed bag, and pretty much a perfect fit for the MacBook Pro, stored inside of a sleeve case. At first I thought I would replace my Manhattan Portage bag, which was just barely too small for the MacBook Pro, with the bigger version of the same bag, the 1635. But that bag was WAY too big- the MacBook was swimming in there. This bag is a comfortable fit, with a little room on either side of the MacBook when the bag isn't too full. And there is plenty of room to carry a number of regular books (or whatever else) in addition to the MacBook. It also has an ideal number of smaller pockets - not too many, not too few - for storing accessories. For my needs, the pockets are intelligently placed and sized so I feel like there is a place for everything, and I don't feel like there are any useless pockets.  Most of the smaller pockets are inside the main compartment, on the side opposite the one that's against your body when you're wearing the bag. This makes them convenient to access while the bag is on. And one problem I had with the Manhattan Portage bag was that the smaller pockets were on the side that's against your body, so whatever was in the main compartment of the bag would get in the way of accessing the smaller pockets. Since these are on the opposite side, the pockets are easy to get to even when the bag is relatively full. One of the pockets has a key ring, but unlike some bags, this one is attached to a long ""leash"", so the keys can actually sit at the bottom of the pocket until you need them. They don't get in the way when you are trying to get other things out, but when you do want them, you just fish them out by grabbing the top of the ""leash"". A waterproof liner was an essential feature when I was searching for a bag (I'm paranoid about being caught in a downpour with my laptop), and although this one hasn't been put to the test yet, it seems even better than my previous bag, which always kept the contents dry. One problem with the Manhattan Portage bag was that when the flap was closed there were gaps at the top on both sides, near where the shoulder strap attaches. Although this bag has a similar design, it doesn't seem to have the same problem. I do wish this bag came with a shoulder pad for the strap, but that is my only complaint and I'm sure I can purchase one separately. And the price on Amazon is significantly cheaper than I could find anywhere else, so I can put my savings toward the shoulder strap",United States,NY

They're very comfortable and are holding up a lot better than my department store brand socks ever did.  (One pair of those had a hole after two or three wearings!)  They are definitely thicker than a dress sock, and slightly thicker than some casual socks, so if your shoes fit very tightly, these are probably not the socks you want.  They are not as thick as a heavy winter wool or hiking sock, however.  They are great with my casual shoes, though, and work very well with my work shoes.

Not only were they the best pair of tennis shoes I had ever worn, but they were also the most comforable.  They still are to this day and, in an era where shoes are become more and more of an esoteric item, it is immensely satisfying to see adidas still making these classics (such as the sambas for soccer, and such as good old canvas chuck taylors for basketball).

I have been nursing for over 8 months now and have been using THE SAME BREAST PADS.  No; not just the same brand but the very same two breast pads I brought to the hospital when I gave birth.  These things are the coolest things.  As long as you keep them clean, they will adhere to the breasts and stop leakage just as the description promises.  Furthermore, these are also great if you are planning on returning to work while pumping/ continuing to nurse.  They are very thin and the profiles are smooth so you won't have to worry about that bulky/ obviously-nursing look which ruins many a beautiful blouse.At first I had a little problem getting them absolutely clean but I then I used my body glove to scrub them while I was in the shower and voila!  I have not been tempted to write another review of any other products I have but I just can't believe more women have not discovered the wonder of these things.  Another possible drawback is that the pads by nature don't allow for air circulation.  I suggest removing them for as long as you can for a few hours a day so the skin around your nipples can breathe... Removing each pad after a feeding works well for me but you will know what works best for you.  In any case; take a look at the price.  That's all I have spent on pads in 8 months.  What a bargain and an even bigger convenience.  Kudos to the makers of Lily-Padz.  A great shower gift too if you know someone who is expecting to breastfteed",United States,GA

Highly recommended.--- Update: 2 or 3 months after getting this bag, the leather which binds the shoulder strap to the main bag split, making the shoulder strap unusable. However, the seller has been extremely helpful in taking care of the situation, and the manufacturer is looking at the stitching in their design to see if it needs to be strengthened. I look forward to getting my great bag back",United States,MI

B0009SXC4O,"Wrangler Men's PBR Slim Fit Jean, Dark Denim: Apparel",apparel,3 of 3,5.0,choosing a the right fit ,"May 17, 2006",Great Faulkner's Ghost,"Washington, DC","If you are used to Levi's or the regular Wrangler jeans, here's some help in choosing a the right fit for this. This jean is the ""slim"" version of classic Cowboy Cut jean that Wrangler has been making since 1947. Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 512,but it is cut slimmer in the seat. It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher. It has a zipper fly. The so-called ""rigid denim"" looks a lot like the ""shrink to fit"" rigid denim of the Levi's button fly 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends. The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized. So, you should buy your correct size, erring on the side of slightly larger if you are right on the border.  Compared to the regular the Wrangler Cowboy Cut, the this slim Fit is quite a bit skimpier. The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut. If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat. Wranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now. These definitely are not so-called ""destructed"" jeans. You won't find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi's. Overall, these are very solid well-made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi's models. Like Levi's, they are well made and indestructible. ",United States,DC

It's extremely lightweight and it feels kind of like Tyvek. But here's the weird thing. The dang thing works. It doesn't have vents or pockets or anything but manages to keep the rain out and not get super condensed on the inside with sweat. It's the one rain jacket I took with me on my 2500 mile Canada to Mexico ride along the Great Divide. The first day it poured and this jacket did great. It's never leaked and I've used it a ton in rides around my home turf of the Pacific Northwest.After 10 months of pretty hard use the jacket did develop some little tears and if you aren't careful you can rip the material. So for a day-in, day out jacket you might want something stronger and pricier like a Burley or a Showers Pass jacket (or Rainshield's pricer nylon O2 jacket) but at $35 this jacket does better than a lot of jackets costing 4 or 5 times as much.

Well, after three months of looking (offline, too), I was ready to give up. We're having a very small, relatively casual outdoor May wedding, and I couldn't find anything that really fit my idea of what I want to wear. Then I found Tension Dress (bad name!) on Amazon.I bought the ivory in one size larger than I usually wear (XL, even though generally I'm a 12), since it looked like juniors sizing and I'm 5'10"". It fits perfectly (and since the back laces up, you have a little ""wiggle room"" in the fit). I'm planning to have it shortened to tea length (the only adjustment I'll need to make), but even at my height the full length is just right with a 2.5"" heel.The fabric looks and feels nicer in person than in the photos on the site. I actually ended up ordering it directly from gojane.com's site, since they had more size and color options than were showing up on Amazon. Even with expedited shipping (I ordered it Sunday night, late, and it was here by Thursday afternoon), the total was less than $100. Not bad for a beautiful wedding dress! I couldn't be more pleased.

Corsi,albany ny,"I think I had more of a laugh reading the reviews for this than the bracelet could ever give me. I also find it funny that someone can give a review on a product that they've never used. I will be purchasing one of these so my review is justified. Does this bracelet take away from cancer funds? you could say yes, but then again buying soda does the same thing. Its called frivelous spending. Is it mocking the livestrong band? well yeah but then again, we have weird al and bumper stickers that have been doing that for years. With some reviews, i swear i should be nexy yo some of them wearing the ""i'm with stupid"" t-shirt. Its a joke people, lighten up. Oh and all of you that are worried that people should donate money to a cause should ask themselves on how uptight can they get with this. Take it this way, I can donate and not care if anyone else knows, but the people that are the most uptight are usually the ones that go up to people and raise thier banded arm in front of people and go ""i donated, yes i did, and got this cool bracelet, which means i donated"". This is a fad, and the ones that are the most uptight about this are upset cause they didn't think of it first. So get over being scrooge and livewrong!",United States,NY

It has been a conversation starter, but mostly it has been a way for me to say something about myself in a rather innocuous way.I recently broke one that was given to me by a friend. I wore it daily and liked the sentiment. If you can't enjoy life - why bother living it? Then again - if you aren't enjoying life, are you really living? ""LiveWrong"" doesn't take anything away from the good work that many are doing - nor does it fall into the category of all the pseudo-charities who are jumping on the band wagon.

I think these bracelets are exactly what they are supposed to be, funny.I believe they are a personal statement, as is every other colored band that is sold.  What I think is wierd is the uproar this has caused on both sides.The truly offensive people are those who feel they can judge a person by any bracelet, hat or car.  While I drive my SUV I wear no bracelets of any color.  I have taken the advice of D.L. Hereford and D. Ray ""conspiracy theory"" and send my chairitable contributions direct.  I contribute time as well as money to what I believe in and time slipping a bracelet on and off doesn't count.I have a daughter-in-law who does relay walks and other fund raising activities while she wears her yellow bracelet.  I think she considers the bracelet less important than the rest.  I think Silent Bob would approve.Brent Freakin' Wilson, your anger over this is way overboard.  I sense other personal issues.

They  cost a little more than a year ago, but they are a very good quality and have lasted through many washings. They are very comfortable,light weight and fit loose around the ab and waist area, which I prefer to something clingy. The fit is short, but not too short, hitting just below the waist. I wear it often, and found it versatile enough to wear with low-cut jeans, for sleep, yoga and working out. The color(grey) did not fade much with all the washings, but I did find that, after a while, it lost it's shape just a little and sometimes it came out a little wrinkled from the dryer(dried on low), but usually smoothed out by hand when I folded it. It did not wrinkle during wear(except when I slept in it) and it did not shrink at all.I liked the loose  fit, the comfy cool feeling of the fabric, and the quality enough to order a couple more for the hot summer coming up. I usually wear a large in most tops, but I usually go for an  X-large in short tees, so it just hits a little lower and is a little looser.And by the way..""Bare Necessities"", the store I purchased this tee through, was very good with packaging and prompt delivery.It a great buy...Happy Shopping...Lauri",United States,CA

I may have to try one of the other colors to see if it's just the one I selected or a design issue. The ""tab"" that holds the two shell halves together protrudes slightly and when the 'pod lies flat on a surface, this tab tends to pop open. The one I've been using loses it's tension over a matter of days and the unit pops open unexpectedly. I'll try a different one to see if this is just a quirk on the one I've been using.

I don't mind it. Actually, as a refugee from NYC (which post-9/11 and the Bloomberg anti-Smoking Nazis is not half the brazen City it once was), I chose Utah because of the snow, the mountains, the free & easy gun laws, fewer people, and skiing. But what I don't dig is the Arctic temperatures, especially because I have an evening cigar outside every night, and it dampens the delights of cigar-smoking to have your face and eyeballs freeze. What to do? I took a page from the strategy-book of Chiapan Revolutionary & mask-wearing bandito SubCommandante Marcos, who wears his hairy woolly black face-shrouding balaclava wherever he goes. I dig the SubCommandante; dig his style, dig his stature, dig his designer AKs, dig his Listening Tour about the country taken on a black motorbike, a kind of 21st century homage to Che. Dig all if it, Comrade, you know? But what I dig most of all is his ability to light & smoke his stogie through the little mouth-hole in his black balaclava. He does this all the time: there's SubCommandante, with his stogie, and he's got it sticking out of the little mouthhole, puffing away on it merrily. So I figured: if it works for El Jefe down in Chiapas where it's 105 degrees in the shade, it probably will work wonders for me up in the mountains of Utah, where it's 5 below zero beneath the moon? Ya venceremos! Sure enough, I'm digging it: I can go outside, smoke my cigar to my heart's content, and have a toasty face that doesn't freeze & splinter in the subzero frore winter blast. All well & good, even though after a few heady puffs the little mouth aperture gets a wee tad bit stinky, but oh well, that's what a washing machine was made for. Also, the ski-mask is well made, solidly sewn, and no doubt would be awesome for a cold-weather counterinsurgency. That said, there is one big drawback: every time I wear the thing, I have an urge to carry out guerilla warfare against the bourgeois pig McMansion owner over the fence. JS",United States,PA

Crabtree ""Photographer/Public Assitant""",Ohio,"I just got these sneaks recently.  I am going through the wear-in phase of the shoes.  So these opinions are based soley, no pun intended, on my time with them so far.Originally I had gotten a pair of the Jordan Hoops Low.  I loved the style and got a good deal on them.  Well, I found out that 13 in Jordan is more like 11 or 12 in other shoes.  So I had them returned for a 14. I got the 14's and they were long enough..just not wide enough.  It was then that I found out most of the Jordan b-ball shoes are pretty thin width.  I told the guy that I am willing to look at what they have in the store to just get something that I can try on.  I ended up trying the KG A3 and they felt nice.  I tried on these T-Mac 6s next and they feel better than the KGs overall.  The KGs felt better on the heel, but that was the only place.  Everywhere else, the T-Macs are more comfortable and it is the perfect width.Just on the shoe...they are hurting my feet just a bit..but that is common for me for the break in period.  I am overweight and flat footed so it takes a while for me to get my shoes comfortable.  They are also warm inside. I am just wearing normal cotton socks right now, not my new Jordan dri-fit socks which wick better. I notice that there are no ventilation holes on the the shoe like most have.  None on the toe area..none on the tongue..and none on the sides.  There is also no meshy fabric to help ventilation either.One thing I worry about is the ""stability system"" on the bottom of the shoe.  Long term..it seems like it would be like the Shox system.  My local shoe expert says he gets many returns for Shox that have been torn or worn at the Shox part prematurely but never had any T-Macs back yet.  I guess we will see",United States,IN

I've been hooked on wayfarers style since the Blue Brothers were the 80's equivalent of the New Kids on the Block, but the price can be prohibitive.  There are cheap knock-offs out there at low prices, but the quality shows in the cloudy eyepiece and dull plastic in the earpieces.Not so OC Shade's Classic Wayfarer Sunglasses.  The quality is virtually indistinguishable from similar brand name styles at many times the price.  I was so pleased with my initial purchase that I've laid in a small supply of these sunglasses, stocking up on both smoke/black and tortoise combinations.  Some people have complained that the glasses are smaller that similar big name brands - not so.  I've uploaded a picture of the OC shades compared with a similar big name brand that cost me over $100 - I defy you to tell the difference (well - if you know where to look for the obscured logo, you can figure it out!)  But, other than that - there's no difference.I advise you to buy as many pairs of these glasses as you have people in your household who wear (and lose) classically styled and great looking shades.

I find it hard to find jeans that fit me right because I have a small, well-defined waist but more generous hips, buttocks, and thighs; most jeans that fit my lower half have a large gap at the back of the waist.  When I tried these jeans on in my usual size, 8, they were a bit too tight, but when I went up to a size 10, they fit quite well.  There is a *slight* gap at the back of the waist when I wear this jeans, but because the fabric has a hint of spandex, they fit my body well enough to wear without a bit.  The spandex also makes these jeans extremely comfortable; they hug my body nicely without feeling the least bit tight.  I also love the low rise, which falls an inch or two below my belly button, just where I like it, and the boot cut, which gives my short legs a wonderfully long, lean look.  I'm just shy of 5'5"", and the 32"" inseam is a bit long on me, but I prefer my jeans on the longer side these days, so the length seems just right.

Definitely the best shoe purchase I ever made.  These are by far the most expensive shoes of any kind I have ever bought, and they were totally worth every penny.  In fact I bought a second pair of this same model because the first one was so good.  Normally I'd get five pairs of running shoes for the price of these two. (I'd love to get these at a deep discount, but just haven't found them anywhere.)They take a lot of wear and tear.  I have run and walked well over 1,000 miles in these shoes and they are still practically like new, just a little worn in the center of the front sole.  Which is doubly amazing considering that I weigh over 250 pounds.  Usually I blow out a pair of shoes after just 300 or 400 miles.  Aside from being slightly warm they are amazingly comfortable.  I can wear them all day at work, or for a fifteen-mile walk, and not have any discomfort.  The fit has been perfect, and usually that's a problem area for me.  These are snug without binding, and have all the right support in the right places.  No appreciable wear has occurred on the interior lining of the shoe.Brooks has been a very good brand for me, and these are far and away the best of their line that I have tried.

Most importantly, the bra supports and yet has smooth lines under silky clothes and the front dips below the waist so you don't have that sausage roll effect where the abdomen bulges when the bra stops.  Another plus is that it comes with clear straps you can use for extra support.  I only have 2 negatives.  First, I believe the ad said it came with both clear AND straps to match the bra but when it arrived only clear was included.  (I didn't pursue this.)  However, the biggest negative is that the cups are not just lined but padded.  I personally find that makes the bra less useful and can even disturb the lines of some clothing.

Pathfinder Carrier: Apparel,apparel,16 of 16,5.0,Great carrier but should have skipped the sun shade,"September 18, 2005","Displaced Yinzer ""mom to the Tadpole""","South Bay Area, CA United States","We've had this carrier for 7-8 months and have only used it to go hiking - our intended purpose - a handful of times.  We used to go backpacking a lot in our childless days and I would not say this carrier is quite as comfortable as the pack I used for that (a Gregory) *but* then again my Gregory pack has always just ridden quietly on my back and doesn't throw its weight around and yell in my ear.  I think the wiggle of the cargo accounts for the difference in comfort, and the difference is not that big.  Still, I have never hiked more than 6 miles with my kid in this and I can't imagine going much further than that.  I'm willing to admit this is due more to my going soft than poor pack design, though.We can fit all his diaper supplies in the attached backpack if we use disposables, tie a few toys off the loops on the carrier, and stuff a sippie cup in the holder in back, and it makes for a nicely contained baby unit for a day hike.What I have found this pack to be unexpectedly great for is to use in place of a stroller where strollers are a hinderence - such as historical sites - or for walking around the mall or grocery store.  My kid has reached this point where he hates to ride in the shopping cart and tries to climb out, but for some reason he is happy as a clam riding up high on my back in this pack.  Generally happier than when in the stroller, even.  Never fights to get down.My husband and I can both use this pack comfortably.  I am about 5'4 and use the pack on the second from the smallest setting; he is 5'10 and uses it maybe 2 settings bigger.  I think there are about 8 settings in all so this could certainly work well for a wide range of people.From a kid perspective, my boy is about 30 pounds, 35 or 36 inches, and he's riding with the seat in the middle (of 3) adjustment.  The only thing I don't like about it is the sunshade/rainhood, which is included with this model but makes this model more expensive than the next model down, which I think is called the Journey.  We just never use it because it wigs my kid out so we should have saved the money.I also looked at REI's child carriers, Baby Trend, and a lower priced Kelty (Base Camp, I think?) and the suspension just didn't compare.  The Pathfinder line is just much, much more comfortable.  I don't even understand why Kelty puts out carriers like the Base Camp.My only regret is not having gotten a frame carrier sooner.  I overestimated at which point he'd be ready for one",United States,CA

Menchaca,"Austin, TX, United States","I've been using the GT-2000 series shoes for about 2+ years now, and I can honestly say, they're the most comfortable running shoes for my build.  This is one of Asics best, if not the best, selling shoes because it offers such a wide variety of fit for most foot types.These shoes are mainly designed for the moderate to heavy over-pronator (when the feet roll in too much) with low to medium arches, but I've met fellow runners with the same shoe who have medium to high arches.  I, myself, am flat-footed, but use orthotics.  This can be a major problem for me when buying shoes because I need something with a wide enough heel to allow my orthotics to fit, and these work great.  Don't worry if you don't have a wide heel because there is memory foam embedded in the heel that forms to your foot over time.  The heel and forefoot also offer a good amount of stability and support.  The shoe is designed for medium to large builds, but again, I've come across other runners who are much lighter and use the same shoe.  When I first began running, I weighed 300+ pounds, now at 216 pounds, the shoes still work well (I've bought newer version of this shoe as I've worn the others out).  The ""Upper"" (the top parts of the shoe) are really comfortable.  It's made of a mesh material that allows a maximum amount of air and circulation into the foot, while allowing all the heat, moisture & sweat out.  The shoe is so comfortable, you could easily run in it without socks (which I have done only a few times).  The 2000 series are versatile, they're well priced, and they come in a variety of sizes, widths, and colors, so chances are they'll fit you.  This is by far the best running shoe I've used up to date, and would recommend it to anyone who is just starting or a long time runner.",United States,TX

This bag is very large and accomodating of all your needs, male or female. It is indeed very roomy and I would classify it as a daybag or travelbag because it isn't as limited as most ""lunchbags"", but still great for days at the office. For those of you that are troubled by coworkers ""borrowing"" your food and drinks from the company refrigerator, your troubles will be over with this bag. Tons of room to include cooling packs to keep at least a long day's worth of food and drinks chilly. The top of the bag has a seperate section that will hold all your other daily needs, whether it be reading material, including full size magazines you won't have to roll up or to fit in, medications, keys, cell phone, PDAs and what have you. The other compartments will accomodate you further. Conveniently, there are compartments where you can keep things hidden, so that personal items or valuables don't have to be displayed at any time, unless you choose to do so. This bag appears to be really well made, nothing cheap about it or ill planned. The zipper pulls alone tell the story, large, heavy and solid, accomodating for the smaller hand all the way up to very large men's hands. The stitching appears to be very well done and not prone to come apart easily. The dual handles at the top will allow for carrying with one hand, or clip on the adjustable strap for a more hands free tote. The thickness of the insulation is more than adequate, much thicker than most of the off the shelf type insualted bags, it is what you would expect in a premium bag. The fabric is quality denier that looks like it will be able to hold up to heavy use and easy to wipe clean, like most denier. I would not be surprised to see a flight crew carrying this insulated tote, as it has the style of simple elegance that you usually see with their carryons, suitable for even a daybag phobic male, but sleek enough for a woman to feel as though she hasn't just joined a brown bagger construction crew. This bag doesn't look out of place in the office or at a worksite, the beauty of classic neutral design for the causual person or professional. It has enough capacity to work for a picnic bag for several people. My mother was eyeing it for use to carry all her copious amounts of makeup on her trip to Vegas, with keeping all of it cool in mind. That plot didn't succeed, it has not yet seen Vegas, but nice try mom, lol. The sticker shock for this bag may seem high if you are used to throw away bags from mass retailers, but this is a worthwhile investment for those needing quality and more space. Overall value very high and more than worth the money. Hey, just what the coworkers swipe in a month's time might pay for the whole bag by itself.",United States,PA

By one size larger than you normally use. 2. Buy white or black. I bought a ""mint green"" pair which turned out to be in a girly, light blue color - certainly not the color advertised",United States,

B000IW5TE2,Men's Danner Radical 452 GTX: Apparel,apparel,14 of 14,5.0,Sometimes being Radical is a good thing,"November 21, 2006",C. Ryan,"Winthrop, WA United States","I have 43 years of hiking, backpacking and peak bagging experience. In recent years I migrated, like most people, from all-leather European-style mountain boots to lighter fabric/leather combination boots. They seemed to work well for a while but two years ago I started experiencing significant pain in my toes, instep and heel. I concluded that my lightweight boots from a well known outdoor supplier were a contributing factor, if not the root of the problem because they didn't provide sufficient torsional (side-to-side) rigidity.Danner's advertisement for the ""Terra Force"" boot support system convinced me to buy the Radical GTX two years ago.The first thing I liked about the Radicals was the roomy box toe area that eliminated occasional rubbing problems caused by my prior boots' smaller toe box. There was also plenty of instep space for my high arch. Unlike many boots that now come in a single width the Radical's multiple widths allow a wider fit in the ball of the foot while retaining the snug heel fit that prevents blisters.The Terra Force torsional support has not diminished after 250+ miles of hiking. Besides day hikes and 2-3 day backpacks I've used the Radicals with good results on off-trail scrambles to summits in the High Sierra and North Cascades, occasionally crossing snow steep enough to require an ice axe. Despite offering much more support than my prior lightweight boots the Radicals are hardly heavier (my size 10.5-EE's weigh 52 ounces). Best of all, after switching to the Radicals my toe and instep problems ceased almost immediately, and my heel problems have gradually diminished substantially, all of which I attribute to the superior support of the Terra Force system.In my opinion these boots have too many seams and different pieces of leather and fabric, but I'm not marking down my rating because that's how virtually all lightweight, relatively inexpensive boots are made these days",United States,WA

The suit did not fit and I didn't wear it for what I bought it for. It's now just hanging in my closet. It was a $60.00 suit. It cost $11.00 to ship it to me.

The quality of the beanie is great; it looks like it would last for a long time, and I really like its looks.And I do have a decent sized dome (7 1/2 in fitted hats).  But this lid fit my one-year-old son's head better than it does mine.  It kind of sits on my head like a yarmulke, barely covering my giant bald spot.So if you're concerned at all about it being too small, it probably is.  If you've got a smallish noggin, this would probably be a sweet beanie",United States,CA

This is such a comfortable bra and molds to the bosom so well and minimizes so nicely, that it is truly a great pitty the cheap plastic hoops and strap fasteners break apart and ruin the bra so you can't wear it anymore. Also for large sizes the bra would be perfect if it had softer straps and a wider band and more rows for hooks in the back. This could be one of the world's greatest minimizer bras if Bali, the manufacturer upgraded it as stated. Unfortunately the life of the bra is too short to make it worthwhile buying because it just falls apart. ",United States,
